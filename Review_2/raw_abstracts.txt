Subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are associated with significant morbidity and are a major cause of premature mortality among cancer survivors. Several large studies have demonstrated a strong association between the radiation and/or chemotherapy used to treat primary cancer and the risk of developing SMNs. However, for any given therapeutic exposure, the risk of developing an SMN varies between individuals. Genomic variation can potentially modify the association between therapeutic exposures and SMN risk and may explain the observed interindividual variability. In this review, the author provides a brief overview of the current knowledge regarding the role of genomic variation in the development of therapy-related SMNs and discusses the methodological challenges in undertaking an endeavor to develop a deeper understanding of the molecular underpinnings of therapy-related SMNs, such as an appropriate study design, the identification of an adequately sized study population together with a reliable plan for collecting and maintaining high-quality DNA, clinical validation of the phenotype, and the selection of an appropriate approach or platform for genotyping. Understanding the factors that can modify the risk of treatment-related SMNs is critical to developing targeted intervention strategies and optimizing risk-based health care for cancer survivors.

Purpose: Second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) are severe late complications that occur in pediatric cancer survivors exposed to radiotherapy and other genotoxic treatments. To characterize the mutational landscape of treatment-induced sarcomas and to identify candidate SMN-predisposing variants, we analyzed germline and SMN samples from pediatric cancer survivors.Experimental Design: We performed whole-exome sequencing (WES) and RNA sequencing on radiation-induced sarcomas arising from two pediatric cancer survivors. To assess the frequency of germline TP53 variants in SMNs, Sanger sequencing was performed to analyze germline TP53 in 37 pediatric cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) without any history of a familial cancer predisposition syndrome but known to have developed SMNs.Results: WES revealed TP53 mutations involving p53's DNA-binding domain in both index cases, one of which was also present in the germline. The germline and somatic TP53-mutant variants were enriched in the transcriptomes for both sarcomas. Analysis of TP53-coding exons in germline specimens from the CCSS survivor cohort identified a G215C variant encoding an R72P amino acid substitution in 6 patients and a synonymous SNP A639G in 4 others, resulting in 10 of 37 evaluable patients (27%) harboring a germline TP53 variant.Conclusions: Currently, germline TP53 is not routinely assessed in patients with pediatric cancer. These data support the concept that identifying germline TP53 variants at the time a primary cancer is diagnosed may identify patients at high risk for SMN development, who could benefit from modified therapeutic strategies and/or intensive posttreatment monitoring.

BACKGROUND: Holocaust survivors during World War II were exposed to various factors that are associated with cancer risk. The objective of this study was to determine whether Holocaust survivors had an increased risk for developing cancer. METHODS: The study population included 152,622 survivors. The main analysis was based on a comparison between individuals who were entitled to compensation for suffering persecution during the war and individuals who were denied such compensation. A complementary analysis compared survivors who were born in countries governed by Nazi Germany with survivors born in nonoccupied countries. A Cox proportional hazards model was used, with the time at risk of cancer development starting on either January 1, 1960, or the date of immigration to the date of cancer diagnosis or death or the date of last follow-up (December 31, 2006). RESULTS: Cancer was diagnosed in 22.2% of those who were granted compensation versus 16% of those who were denied compensation (P < .0001). Adjusting for birth cohort, sex, country of origin, and period of immigration, both analyses revealed significant increased risks of developing cancer in those who were exposed. For those who were granted versus denied compensation, the hazard ratios were 1.06 (P < .001) for all sites, 1.12 (P = .07) for colorectal cancer, and 1.37 (P = .008) for lung cancer. For those born in occupied countries versus nonoccupied countries, the hazard ratios were 1.08 (P < .001), 1.08 (P = .003), and 1.12 (P = .02), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The current results, based on a large cohort of Holocaust survivors who were exposed to a variety of severe deprivations, add to the conflicting and sparse knowledge on this issue and support the notion that this group has a small but consistent increase in cancer development.

BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence rates and trends for cases diagnosed through 2014 using data reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program in February 2016 and a validation of rates and trends for cases diagnosed through 2013 and submitted in February 2015 using the November 2015 submission are reported. New cancer sites include the pancreas, kidney and renal pelvis, corpus and uterus, and childhood cancer sites for ages birth to 19 years inclusive. METHODS: A new reporting delay model is presented for these estimates for more consistent results with the model used for the usual November SEER submissions, adjusting for the large case undercount in the February submission. Joinpoint regression methodology was used to assess trends. Delay-adjusted rates and trends were checked for validity between the February 2016 and November 2016 submissions. RESULTS: Validation revealed that the delay model provides similar estimates of eventual counts using either February or November submission data. Trends declined through 2014 for prostate and colon and rectum cancer for males and females, male and female lung cancer, and cervical cancer. Thyroid cancer and liver and intrahepatic bile duct cancer increased. Pancreas (male and female) and corpus and uterus cancer demonstrated a modest increase. Slight increases occurred for male kidney and renal pelvis, and for all childhood cancer sites for ages birth to 19 years. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluating early cancer data submissions, adjusted for reporting delay, produces timely and valid incidence rates and trends. The results of the current study support using delay-adjusted February submission data for valid incidence rate and trend estimates over several data cycles. Cancer 2017;123:2524-34.

BACKGROUND: The authors describe the incidence and characteristics of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors compared with those in younger and older cancer survivors. METHODS: Children aged </= 14 years, AYAs aged 15 to 39, and older adults aged >/= 40 years at the time of primary diagnosis who were reported as cancer survivors in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program between 1973 and 2011 were compared in this population-based analysis. The primary analysis was the risk that an SMN would occur >/= 5 years after the original diagnosis for patients who had the more common AYA cancers (leukemia, lymphoma, testicular malignancy, ovarian malignancy, melanoma, and cancers of the thyroid, breast, soft tissue, or bone). The standardized incidence ratio (SIR), absolute excess risk (AER), and cumulative incidence of SMN for the selected cancers were assessed. The risk of SMN for the entire cohort also was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 148,558 AYA survivors who were diagnosed with a selected cancer, 7384 developed an SMN 5 years after their original diagnosis. The SIRs (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) were 1.58 (95% CI, 1.55-1.62) for AYAs, 4.26 (95% CI, 3.77-4.80) for children, and 1.10 (95% CI, 1.09-1.11) for older adults, and the AERs were 22.9, 16.6, and 14.7, respectively. The cumulative incidence of SMN at 30 years was 13.9% for the AYA group. The most common SMNs in AYAs were breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, genital cancers, and melanoma. AYAs who had received radiation therapy had a higher cumulative incidence of SMN. CONCLUSIONS: AYAs who survive cancer for more than 5 years have a higher relative risk of SMN compared with the general population and have a higher absolute risk of SMN compared with younger or older cancer survivors.

RATIONALE: Multiple primary neoplasms (MPNs) are rare. Most MPNs are double, and triple primary neoplasms are extremely rarer. Here, we describe a case of a 66-year-old man diagnosed with metachronous triple primary neoplasms with primary prostate cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient complained of dysuria in January 2015, and he underwent transurethral resection of the prostate. The pathological results showed acinar adenocarcinoma of prostate with a Gleason score of 3+3. In January 2017, he complained of lower abdominal pain, then he took an enteroscopy examination, found a mass in the sigmoid colon, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography examination showed masses in the sigmoid colon and right upper lobe of the lung. Biopsy of the colon showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog exon 2 mutation, and biopsy of the lung showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with epidermal rowth factor receptor exon 21 mutation. DIAGNOSES: Metachronous triple primary neoplasms with primary prostate cancer, lung cancer and colon cancer. INTERVENTIONS: The patient underwent surgical resection of the right upper lobe of the lung, postoperative stage was T1bN0M0 (stage IA). After 8 cycles of chemotherapy with modified FOLFOX6 regimen (oxaliplatin 85 mg/m, leucovorin 400 mg/m, 5-fluorouracil 400 mg/m on day 1, followed by 5-fluorouracil 2400 mg/m intravenous infusion over 46 hours every 2 weeks), the patient underwent radical resection of colon cancer, and he finished the remaining 4 cycles of modified FOLFOX6 regimen chemotherapy in November 2017. OUTCOMES: The patient takes examination every three months, and the results show no recurrence. LESSONS: When considering MPNs, thorough surveillance by new screening methods is required to detect a second or even third neoplasm at an early stage.

BACKGROUND: Sub-Saharan African-born blacks (ABs) are one of the fastest-growing populations in the United States. However, to the authors' knowledge, data regarding the cancer burden in this group are lacking, which would inform targeted cancer prevention and control. METHODS: The authors calculated age-standardized proportional incidence ratios (PIRs) comparing the frequency of the top 15 cancers in ABs with that of US-born non-Hispanic blacks (USBs) by sex and region of birth using incidence data for 2000 through 2012 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER 17) program. RESULTS: Compared with USBs, ABs had significantly higher PIRs of infection-related cancers (liver, stomach, and Kaposi sarcoma), blood cancers (leukemia and non-Hodgkin lymphoma), prostate cancer, and thyroid cancers (females only). For example, the PIR for Kaposi sarcoma in AB versus USB women was 12.06 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 5.23-18.90). In contrast, ABs had lower PIRs for smoking-related and colorectal cancers (eg, for lung cancer among men, the PIR was 0.30 [95% CI, 0.27-0.34]). Furthermore, cancer occurrence in ABs versus USBs varied by region of birth. For example, the higher PIRs for liver cancer noted among male ABs (PIR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.79-5.35) and for thyroid cancer in female ABs (PIR, 3.03; 95% CI, 2.03-4.02) were confined to Eastern African-born blacks, whereas the higher PIR for prostate cancer (PIR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.78, 2.02) was confined to Western African-born blacks. CONCLUSIONS: The cancer incidence profile of ABs is different from that of USBs and varies by region of birth, suggesting differences in environmental, cultural, social, and genetic factors. The findings of the current study could stimulate etiologic research and help to inform targeted interventions. Cancer 2017;123:3116-24. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Current national cancer screening recommendations include the potential risk of psychological harm related to screening. However, data on the relation of psychological distress to cancer screening is limited. The authors conducted a systematic review to assess psychological distress associated with cancer screening procedures. METHODS: Studies that administered measures of psychological distress between 2 weeks before and 1 month after the screening procedure were included. RESULTS: In total, 22 eligible studies met criteria for review, including 13 observational trials and 9 randomized controlled trials. Eligible studies used a broad range of validated and unvalidated measures. Anxiety was the most commonly assessed construct and was measured using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory. Studies included breast, colorectal, prostate, lung, and cervical screening procedures. Distress was low across procedures, with the exception of colorectal screening. Distress did not vary according to the time at which distress was measured. None of the studies were conducted exclusively with the intention of assessing distress at the time of screening. CONCLUSIONS: Evidence of low distress during the time of cancer screening suggests that distress might not be a widespread barrier to screening among adults who undergo screening. However, more studies are needed using validated measures of distress to further understand the extent to which screening may elicit psychological distress and impede adherence to national screening recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Unlike Medicare, the Veterans Health Administration (VA) health care system does not require veterans with cancer to make the "terrible choice" between receipt of hospice services or disease-modifying chemotherapy/radiation therapy. For this report, the authors characterized the VA's provision of concurrent care, defined as days in the last 6 months of life during which veterans simultaneously received hospice services and chemotherapy or radiation therapy. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included veteran decedents with cancer during 2006 through 2012 who were identified from claims with cancer diagnoses. Hospice and cancer treatment were identified using VA and Medicare administrative data. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the changes in concurrent care, hospice, palliative care, and chemotherapy or radiation treatment. RESULTS: The proportion of veterans receiving chemotherapy or radiation therapy remained stable at approximately 45%, whereas the proportion of veterans who received hospice increased from 55% to 68%. The receipt of concurrent care also increased during this time from 16.2% to 24.5%. The median time between hospice initiation and death remained stable at around 21 days. Among veterans who received chemotherapy or radiation therapy in their last 6 months of life, the median time between treatment termination and death ranged from 35 to 40 days. There was considerable variation between VA medical centers in the use of concurrent care (interquartile range, 16%-34% in 2012). CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent receipt of hospice and chemotherapy or radiation therapy increased among veterans dying from cancer without reductions in the receipt of cancer therapy. This approach reflects the expansion of hospice services in the VA with VA policy allowing the concurrent receipt of hospice and antineoplastic therapies. Cancer 2016;122:782-790.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have investigated the risks of subsequent primary neoplasms after adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer. We investigated the risks of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after each of 16 types of AYA cancer. METHODS: The Teenage and Young Adult Cancer Survivor Study is a population-based cohort of 200 945 survivors of cancer diagnosed when aged 15-39 years in England and Wales from Jan 1, 1971, to Dec 31, 2006. The cohort was established using cancer registrations from the Office for National Statistics and the Welsh Cancer registry. Follow-up was from 5-year survival until the first occurrence of death, emigration, or study end date (Dec 31, 2012). In this analysis, we focus on the risk of specific subsequent primary neoplasms after 16 types of AYA cancer: breast; cervical; testicular; Hodgkin lymphoma (female); Hodgkin lymphoma (male); melanoma; CNS (intracranial); colorectal; non-Hodgkin lymphoma; thyroid; soft-tissue sarcoma; ovarian; bladder; other female genital; leukaemia; and head and neck cancer. We report absolute excess risks (AERs; per 10 000 person-years) and cumulative incidence of specific types of subsequent primary neoplasm after each type of AYA cancer. FINDINGS: During the 2 631 326 person-years of follow-up (median follow-up 16.8 years, IQR 10.5-25.2), 12 321 subsequent primary neoplasms were diagnosed in 11 565 survivors, most frequently among survivors of breast cancer, cervical cancer, testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma. AERs of any subsequent primary neoplasms were 19.5 per 10 000 person-years (95% CI 17.4-21.5) in survivors of breast cancer, 10.2 (8.0-12.4) in survivors of cervical cancer, 18.9 (16.6-21.1) in survivors of testicular cancer, 55.7 (50.4-61.1) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 29.9 (26.3-33.6) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. The cumulative incidence of all subsequent primary neoplasms 35 years after diagnosis was 11.9% (95% CI 11.3-12.6) in survivors of breast cancer, 15.8% (14.8-16.7) in survivors of cervical cancer, 20.2% (18.9-21.5) in survivors of testicular cancer, 26.6% (24.7-28.6) in female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, and 16.5% (15.2-18.0) in male survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma. In patients who had survived at least 30 years from diagnosis of cervical cancer, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women, breast cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma in men, we identified a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms that account for 82%, 61%, 58%, 45%, and 41% of the total excess number of neoplasms, respectively. Lung cancer accounted for a notable proportion of the excess number of neoplasms across all AYA groups investigated. INTERPRETATION: Our finding that a small number of specific subsequent primary neoplasms account for a large percentage of the total excess number of neoplasms in long-term survivors of cervical, breast, and testicular cancer, and Hodgkin lymphoma provides an evidence base to inform priorities for clinical long-term follow-up. The prominence of lung cancer after each of these AYA cancers indicates the need for further work aimed at preventing and reducing the burden of this cancer in future survivors of AYA cancer.

BACKGROUND: Second malignant neoplasm is one of the most devastating late effects of childhood cancers. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and survival outcomes of patients developing second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) after surviving childhood cancer in Korea. METHODS: Medical data of childhood cancer patients diagnosed between 1993 and 2012 were obtained from the Korea Central Cancer Registry. The risk of developing SMNs was calculated using standardized incidence ratio (SIR), excess absolute risk (EAR), and cumulative risk. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were estimated, stratified by SMN status. RESULTS: A total of 28,405 childhood cancer patients were diagnosed in the study period, and 337 (1.2%) developed SMN. The total follow-up period was 197,359 person-years at risk (PYR), with a median follow-up duration of 5.6 years. Overall SIR was 20.0, which was 23.2 in women, and 17.6 in men. The overall EAR was 16.4 per 10,000 PYR. The most common types of SMNs, in order of incidence, were other malignant epithelial neoplasms, leukemia, and soft tissue sarcomas. The cumulative incidence of developing SMNs was 0.7% at 5 years, 1.2% at 10 years, and 2% at 15 years. After primary cancer diagnosis, the 10-year overall survival rate of patients with SMNs was 65.1%, which was lower than the 73.4% in patients without SMN. After SMN diagnosis, the 10-year overall survival rate was 55.8%. CONCLUSION: Through this registry-based study of 5.6 years of follow up, childhood cancer survivors were found to be at 20-fold higher risk of developing a malignant neoplasm compared to the general population. The majority of malignant neoplasms are malignant epithelial neoplasms, leukemia, and soft tissue sarcomas. Continued surveillance for assessing long-term risks, and guidance for appropriate long-term follow up of childhood cancer survivors, are needed.

The survival of children with cancer has improved dramatically in the last decades. Survivors of childhood cancer are at increased risk of long-term complications of therapeutic exposure. Second malignant neoplasms are one of the most severe side effects of cancer treatment. The frequency and type of secondary cancers may vary depending on the initial diagnosis, treatment administered and genetic predisposition. This review highlights the risk factors in the development of SMNs in survivors of pediatric cancers and their differences according to primary cancer type, genetic predisposition and treatment admistered. Finally, the review emphasizes the need for life-time follow-up of survivors of childhood cancer for the development of second malignancies.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene variant rs699947 polymorphism and urologic neoplasms risk was studied extensively in recent years. The VEGF gene plays a key role in angiogenesis of urologic neoplasms, but some conclusions are still inconclusive. The aim of this study was to determine whether this polymorphism is a risk factor for susceptibility to urologic neoplasms by conducting a meta-analysis. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 15 different publications from the PubMed, Embase and Medline databases, to better assess the association between VEGF rs699947 polymorphism and urologic neoplasms risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were evaluated using random or fixed effects models. RESULTS: By pooling all eligible studies, we found that the VEGF rs699947 polymorphism was not associated with overall urologic neoplasms. However, subgroup analysis based on cancer types demonstrated that significantly increased association was found between VEGF rs699947 polymorphism and the risk of bladder cancer (BCa) under heterozygous genetic model (OR=1.48, 95%CI=1.17-1.89). And rs699947 polymorphism was also identified an increased risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) under dominant, recessive, homozygous, heterozygous and allelic contrast genetic models, while no association was observed in prostate cancer (PCa). In addition, in subgroup analysis by ethnicity, we found rs699947 polymorphism was associated with Asian population under dominant, homozygous, heterozygous and allelic contrast genetic models. No evidence of publication bias was found (Begg's test, P=0.855; Egger's test, P=0.590). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study showed evidence that the VEGF rs699947 polymorphism was obviously associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer and renal cell carcinoma, particularly in Asian population, while no significant association was observed in overall urologic neoplasms. Future studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to further evaluate these associations in more details.

BACKGROUND: Improved survival for individuals with metastatic cancer accentuates the importance of employment for cancer survivors. A better understanding of how metastatic cancer affects employment is a necessary step toward the development of tools for assisting survivors in this important realm. METHODS: The ECOG-ACRIN Symptom Outcomes and Practice Patterns study was analyzed to investigate what factors were associated with the employment of 680 metastatic cancer patients. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to compare patients stably working with patients no longer working. RESULTS: There were 668 metastatic working-age participants in the analysis: 236 (35%) worked full- or part-time, whereas 302 (45%) had stopped working because of illness. Overall, 58% reported some change in employment due to illness. A better performance status and non-Hispanic white ethnicity/race were significantly associated with continuing to work despite a metastatic cancer diagnosis in the multivariate analysis. The disease type, time since metastatic diagnosis, number of metastatic sites, location of metastatic disease, and treatment status had no significant impact. Among the potentially modifiable factors, receiving hormonal treatment (if a viable option) and decreasing symptom interference were associated with continuing to work. CONCLUSIONS: A significant percentage of the metastatic patients remained employed; increased symptom burden was associated with a change to no longer working. Modifiable factors resulting in work interference should be minimized so that patients with metastatic disease may continue working if this is desired. Improvements in symptom control and strategies developed to help address workplace difficulties have promise for improving this aspect of survivorship.

AIMS: We examined the risk factors and prognostic factors for synchronous esophageal neoplasia (SEN) by comparing the characteristics of hypopharyngeal cancer (HPC) patients with and without SEN. METHODS: We examined 183 patients who were treated with definitive radiotherapy for HPC. Lugol chromoendoscopy screening of the esophagus was performed in all patients before chemoradiotherapy. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients had SEN, 49 patients died of HPC and two died of esophageal cancer. The patients with SEN exhibited significantly higher alcohol consumption than those without SEN (P = 0.018). The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of the 36 patients with SEN was lower than that of the other patients (36.2% vs 63.4%, P = 0.006). The SEN patients exhibited significantly shorter HPC cause-specific survival than the other patients (P = 0.039). Both the OS (P = 0.005) and the HPC cause-specific survival (P = 0.026) of the patients with SEN were significantly shorter than those of the patients without SEN in multivariate analysis. Category 4/T1 stage esophageal cancer was treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), endoscopic treatment or chemotherapy. The 5-year survival rates for esophageal cancer recurrence for CCRT, endoscopic treatment and chemotherapy were 71.5, 43.7 and 0%, respectively. The median (range) survival time (months) of CCRT, endoscopic treatment and chemotherapy was 22.7 (7.5-90.6), 46.44 (17.3-136.7) and 7.98 (3.72-22.8), respectively. CONCLUSION: Advanced HPC patients with SEN might have a poorer prognosis than those without SEN even when the esophageal cancer is detected early and managed appropriately.

PURPOSE: Growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is the most common endocrine late effect observed in childhood cancer survivors (CCS) previously submitted to cranial irradiation. Radiation therapy can also increase the risk of second neoplasms (SNs). Since in previous studies GH replacement therapy was associated with increased incidence of neoplasia, we explored the association between SNs and GH replacement therapy in a cohort of CCS with GHD. METHODS: Within the clinical cohort of CCS referred to the Transition Unit for Childhood Cancer Survivors of Turin between November 2001 and December 2012, we considered all patients who developed GHD as a consequence of cancer therapies. GHD was always diagnosed in childhood. To evaluate the quality of data, our cohort was linked to the Childhood Cancer Registry of Piedmont. RESULTS: GHD was diagnosed in 49 out of 310 CCS included in our clinical cohort. At least one SN was diagnosed in 14 patients, meningioma and basal cell carcinoma being the most common SNs. The cumulative incidence of SNs was similar in GH-treated and -untreated patients (8 SNs out of 26 GH-treated and 6 out of 23 GH-untreated patients; p = 0.331). Age, sex and paediatric cancer type had no impact on SNs development. CONCLUSIONS: In our CCS, GH replacement therapy does not seem to increase the risk of SNs. Anyway, independently from replacement therapy, in these patients we observed an elevated risk of SNs, possibly related to previous radiation therapy, which suggests the need of a close long-term follow-up.

Purpose Childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) are at increased risk for subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs). We evaluated the long-term risk of SMNs in a well-characterized cohort of 5-year CCSs, with a particular focus on individual chemotherapeutic agents and solid cancer risk. Methods The Dutch Childhood Cancer Oncology Group-Long-Term Effects After Childhood Cancer cohort includes 6,165 5-year CCSs diagnosed between 1963 and 2001 in the Netherlands. SMNs were identified by linkages with the Netherlands Cancer Registry, the Dutch Pathology Registry, and medical chart review. We calculated standardized incidence ratios, excess absolute risks, and cumulative incidences. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were used to evaluate treatment-associated risks for breast cancer, sarcoma, and all solid cancers. Results After a median follow-up of 20.7 years (range, 5.0 to 49.8 years) since first diagnosis, 291 SMNs were ascertained in 261 CCSs (standardized incidence ratio, 5.2; 95% CI, 4.6 to 5.8; excess absolute risk, 20.3/10,000 person-years). Cumulative SMN incidence at 25 years after first diagnosis was 3.9% (95% CI, 3.4% to 4.6%) and did not change noticeably among CCSs treated in the 1990s compared with those treated earlier. We found dose-dependent doxorubicin-related increased risks of all solid cancers ( Ptrend < .001) and breast cancer ( Ptrend < .001). The doxorubicin-breast cancer dose response was stronger in survivors of Li-Fraumeni syndrome-associated childhood cancers (leukemia, CNS, and non-Ewing sarcoma) versus survivors of other cancers ( Pdifference = .008). In addition, cyclophosphamide was found to increase sarcoma risk in a dose-dependent manner ( Ptrend = .01). Conclusion The results strongly suggest that doxorubicin exposure in CCSs increases the risk of subsequent solid cancers and breast cancer, whereas cyclophosphamide exposure increases the risk of subsequent sarcomas. These results may inform future childhood cancer treatment protocols and SMN surveillance guidelines for CCSs.

Lower gastrointestinal (GI) neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs) of the colon and rectum are uncommon and not traditionally associated with hereditary GI cancer syndromes. However, with widespread implementation of colorectal cancer screening programs, lower GI NENs are being identified with increasing frequency. We report the first case series of six patients with lower GI NENs who were diagnosed with hereditary GI cancer syndromes by germline testing. Two patients presented with poorly differentiated rectal neuroendocrine carcinoma (NECs) with colonic polyposis and were found to have Familial Adenomatous Polyposis and MYH-Associated Polyposis, respectively. Three patients with colorectal NENs (one well differentiated neuroendocrine tumor, NET, and two NECs), all of which displayed abnormal immunohistochemistry for mismatch repair proteins, were diagnosed with Lynch syndrome. One patient with a goblet cell carcinoid was diagnosed with CHEK2 mutations. All patients met genetic testing guidelines and the diagnosis was made utilizing next generation sequencing gene panel tests. Lower GI NETs should therefore be considered a potential hereditary GI cancer syndrome-associated malignancy in patients who otherwise meet criteria for genetic evaluation.

BACKGROUND: The Oregon Medicaid lottery provided a unique opportunity to assess the causal impacts of health insurance on cancer screening rates within the framework of a randomized controlled trial. Prior studies regarding the impacts of health insurance have almost always been limited to observational evidence, which cannot be used to make causal inferences. METHODS: The authors prospectively followed a representative panel of 16,204 individuals from the Oregon Medicaid lottery reservation list, collecting data before and after the Medicaid lottery drawings. The study panel was divided into 2 groups: a treatment group of individuals who were selected in the Medicaid lottery (6254 individuals) and a control group who were not (9950 individuals). The authors also created an elevated risk subpanel based on family cancer histories. One year after the lottery drawings, differences in cancer screening rates, preventive behaviors, and health status were compared between the study groups. RESULTS: Medicaid coverage resulted in significantly higher rates of several common cancer screenings, especially among women, as well as better primary care connections and self-reported health outcomes. There was little evidence found that acquiring Medicaid increased the adoption of preventive health behaviors that might reduce cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid coverage did not appear to directly impact lifestyle choices that might reduce cancer risk, but it did provide access to important care and screenings that could help to detect cancers earlier. These findings could have long-term population health implications for states considering or pursuing Medicaid expansion. Cancer 2016;122:791-797. (c) 2015 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Pancreatic cancer plays an important role in cancer-related mortality. Few studies have been performed in Brazil to characterize patients affected by this disease. We aimed to describe the clinico-pathological characteristics and the survival of patients with pancreatic cancer seen at AC Camargo Cancer Center (ACCCC). METHODS: We included patients >/= 18-year old, with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic cancer, that attended at least one visit at ACCCC from 2008 to 2016. RESULTS: The study included 739 patients. Median age at diagnosis was 64 years. Most patients were male. About 5% presented a family history of pancreatic cancer. A total of 40% had diabetes and 51.4% presented with ECOG performance status 1. Tumors most often arose in the pancreatic head and roughly half of the patients had metastatic disease at presentation. Median overall survival of patients with potentially resectable disease submitted to surgery at ACCCC was 35.4 months. Median overall survival times of patients with the unresectable and metastatic disease were 14.1 and 9.3 months, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The features of our population match those of studies done in developed countries. We believe multicentric data from patients with pancreatic cancer in Brazil could enable more effective preventive and therapeutic approaches to the disease.

Importance: Although the increased incidence of second primary malignant neoplasms (SPMs) is a well-known late effect after cancer, few studies have compared survival after an SPM to survival of the same cancer occurring as first primary malignant neoplasm (PM) by age. Objective: To assess the survival impact of SPMs in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (15-39 years) compared with that of pediatric (<15 years) and older adult (>/=40 years) patients with the same SPMs. Design, Setting, and Participants: This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study of patients with cancer in 13 Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results regions in the United States diagnosed from 1992 to 2008 and followed through 2013. Data analysis was performed between June 2016 and January 2017. Main Outcomes and Measures: Five-year relative survival was calculated overall and for each cancer occurring as a PM or SPM by age at diagnosis. The impact of SPM status on cancer-specific death was examined using multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression. Results: A total of 15954 pediatric, 125750 AYAs, and 878370 older adult patients diagnosed as having 14 cancers occurring as a PM or SPM were included. Overall, 5-year survival after an SPM was 33.1% lower for children, 20.2% lower for AYAs, and 8.3% lower for older adults compared with a PM at the same age. For the most common SPMs in AYAs, the absolute difference in 5-year survival was 42% lower for secondary non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 19% for secondary breast carcinoma, 15% for secondary thyroid carcinoma, and 13% for secondary soft-tissue sarcoma. Survival by SPM status was significantly worse in younger vs older patients for thyroid, Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, soft-tissue sarcoma, and central nervous system cancer. Adolescents and young adults with secondary Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratio [95% CI], 3.5 [1.7-7.1]); soft-tissue sarcoma (2.8 [2.1-3.9]); breast carcinoma (2.1 [1.8-2.4]); acute myeloid leukemia (1.9 [1.5-2.4]); and central nervous system cancer (1.8 [1.2-2.8]) experienced worse survival compared with AYAs with the same PMs. Conclusion and Relevance: The adverse impact of SPMs on survival is substantial for AYAs and may partially explain the relative lack of survival improvement in AYAs compared with other age groups. The impact of a particular SPM diagnosis on survival may inform age-specific prevention, screening, treatment, and survivorship recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Individual environmental exposures are associated with cancer development; however, environmental exposures occur simultaneously. The Environmental Quality Index (EQI) is a county-level measure of cumulative environmental exposures that occur in 5 domains. METHODS: The EQI was linked to county-level annual age-adjusted cancer incidence rates from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program state cancer profiles. All-site cancer and the top 3 site-specific cancers for male and female subjects were considered. Incident rate differences (IRDs; annual rate difference per 100,000 persons) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using fixed-slope, random intercept multilevel linear regression models. Associations were assessed with domain-specific indices and analyses were stratified by rural/urban status. RESULTS: Comparing the highest quintile/poorest environmental quality with the lowest quintile/best environmental quality for overall EQI, all-site county-level cancer incidence rate was positively associated with poor environmental quality overall (IRD, 38.55; 95% CI, 29.57-47.53) and for male (IRD, 32.60; 95% CI, 16.28-48.91) and female (IRD, 30.34; 95% CI, 20.47-40.21) subjects, indicating a potential increase in cancer incidence with decreasing environmental quality. Rural/urban stratified models demonstrated positive associations comparing the highest with the lowest quintiles for all strata, except the thinly populated/rural stratum and in the metropolitan/urbanized stratum. Prostate and breast cancer demonstrated the strongest positive associations with poor environmental quality. CONCLUSION: We observed strong positive associations between the EQI and all-site cancer incidence rates, and associations differed by rural/urban status and environmental domain. Research focusing on single environmental exposures in cancer development may not address the broader environmental context in which cancers develop, and future research should address cumulative environmental exposures.

BACKGROUND: Programmed death 1 (PD-1) signaling in the tumor microenvironment dampens immune responses to cancer, and blocking this axis induces antitumor effects in several malignancies. Clinical studies of PD-1 blockade are only now being initiated in pediatric patients, and little is known regarding programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in common childhood cancers. The authors characterized PD-L1 expression and tumor-associated immune cells (TAICs) (lymphocytes and macrophages) in common pediatric cancers. METHODS: Whole slide sections and tissue microarrays were evaluated by immunohistochemistry for PD-L1 expression and for the presence of TAICs. TAICs were also screened for PD-L1 expression. RESULTS: Thirty-nine of 451 evaluable tumors (9%) expressed PD-L1 in at least 1% of tumor cells. The highest frequency histotypes comprised Burkitt lymphoma (80%; 8 of 10 tumors), glioblastoma multiforme (36%; 5 of 14 tumors), and neuroblastoma (14%; 17 of 118 tumors). PD-L1 staining was associated with inferior survival among patients with neuroblastoma (P = .004). Seventy-four percent of tumors contained lymphocytes and/or macrophages. Macrophages were significantly more likely to be identified in PD-L1-positive versus PD-L1-negative tumors (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A subset of diagnostic pediatric cancers exhibit PD-L1 expression, whereas a much larger fraction demonstrates infiltration with tumor-associated lymphocytes. PD-L1 expression may be a biomarker for poor outcome in neuroblastoma. Further preclinical and clinical investigation will define the predictive nature of PD-L1 expression in childhood cancers both at diagnosis and after exposure to chemoradiotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Although studies of metastasectomy have been limited primarily to institutional experiences, reports of favorable long-term outcomes have generated increasing interest. In the current study, the authors attempted to define the national practice patterns in metastasectomy for 4 common malignancies with varying responsiveness to systemic therapy. METHODS: The National (Nationwide) Inpatient Sample was used to estimate the national incidence of metastasectomy for colorectal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma from 2000 through 2011. Incidence-adjusted rates were determined for liver, lung, brain, small bowel, and adrenal metastasectomies. The average annual percentage change (AAPC) in metastasectomy by cancer type was calculated using joinpoint regression. RESULTS: Colorectal cancer was the most common indication for metastasectomy (87,407 cases; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 86,307-88,507 cases) followed by lung cancer (58,245 cases; 95% CI, 57,453-59,036 cases), breast cancer (26,271 cases; 95% CI, 25,672-26,870 cases), and melanoma (20,298 cases; 95% CI, 19,897-20,699 cases). Metastasectomy increased significantly for all cancer types over the study period: colorectal cancer (AAPC, 6.83; 95% CI, 5.7-7.9), lung cancer (AAPC, 5.8; 95% CI, 5.1-6.4), breast cancer (AAPC, 5.5; 95% CI, 3.7-7.3), and melanoma (AAPC, 4.03; 95% CI, 2.1-6.0). Despite an increasing number of comorbidities in patients undergoing metastasectomy (P<.05 for each cancer type), inpatient mortality rates after metastasectomy fell for all cancer types, most significantly for colorectal (AAPC, -5.49; 95% CI, -8.2 to -2.7) and lung (AAPC, -6.2; 95% CI, -11.7 to -0.3) cancers. The increasing performance of metastasectomy was largely driven by high-volume institutions, in which patients had a lower mean number of comorbidities (P<.01 for all cancer types) and lower inpatient mortality (P<.01 for all cancers except melanoma). CONCLUSIONS: From 2000 through 2011, the performance of metastasectomy increased substantially across common cancer types, notwithstanding various advances in systemic therapies. Metastasectomy was performed more safely, despite increasing patient comorbidity. High-volume institutions appeared to drive practice patterns.

Several studies have reported an increased incidence of coexistent cancer in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and myelosuppressive treatment has been speculated to be one of the causes. In this study, we have concentrated on malignancies diagnosed before the MPN diagnosis to eliminate the possible influence of MPN treatment. The patients were recruited from the Swedish and Norwegian cancer registries. One thousand seven hundred and 45 patients from the Swedish MPN Quality Registry and 468 patients from the Norwegian National Cancer Registry were included in this study covering a 3-yr period. The results show that primary concurrent cancer is higher among patients with MPN compared to the general population. When pooled together, the Swedish and the Norwegian cohort showed increased prevalence of all types of cancer in general compared with the general population, standard prevalence ratio (SPR) of 1.20 (95% CI 1.07-1.34). Significantly high SPRs were reached for skin malignant melanoma [1.89 (95% CI 1.33-2.62)], prostate cancer [1.39 (95% CI 1.11-1.71)], and hematologic cancer [1.49 (95% CI 1.00-2.12)]. In the polycythemia vera group, the risk of having prior malignant melanoma of the skin was significant, with an SPR of 2.20 (95% CI 1.17-3.77). For patients with essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis, no significant risks were found. Coexisting cancers have a high impact on the treatment strategies of MPN, as it narrows down the treatment options. Chronic inflammation, as a common denominator of MPN with other cancers, can catalyze each other's existence and progression.

BACKGROUND: The survivorship needs of patients living with chronic cancer (CC) and their use of survivorship care plans (SCPs) have been overlooked and underappreciated. METHODS: A convenience sample of 39,088 SCPs completed for cancer survivors with an Internet-based SCP tool was examined; it included 5847 CC survivors (15%; CC was defined as chronic leukemia and/or recurrent/metastatic cancer of another nature). Patient-reported treatment effects and follow-up care patterns were compared between CC survivors and survivors treated with curative intent (CI). Responses from a follow-up survey regarding SCP satisfaction and use were reviewed. RESULTS: CC survivors had greater odds of experiencing multiple treatment-related effects than survivors treated with CI; these effects included fatigue, cognitive changes, dyspnea, peripheral neuropathy, lymphedema, and erectile dysfunction. Nearly half of CC survivors were managed by an oncologist alone, and they were less likely than CI patients to be comanaged by a primary care provider and an oncologist. Fewer SCPs were generated by health care providers (HCPs) for CC survivors versus CI survivors. A smaller proportion of CC users versus CI users rated their experience and satisfaction with the SCP tool as very good or excellent, and CC users were less likely to share the HCP summary with their health care team. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial number of CC survivors, often considered incurable but treatable, seek survivorship support. Tools to facilitate participation, communication, and coordination of care are valuable for these patients, and future iterations of SCPs should be designed to address the particular circumstances of living with CC.

BACKGROUND: American Indians/Alaskan Natives (AI/ANs) have the worst 5-year cancer survival of all racial/ethnic groups in the United States. Causes for this disparity are unknown. The authors of this report examined the receipt of cancer treatment among AI/AN patients compared with white patients. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 338,204 patients who were diagnosed at age >/=65 years with breast, colon, lung, or prostate cancer between 1996 and 2005 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database. Nationally accepted guidelines for surgical and adjuvant therapy and surveillance were selected as metrics of optimal, guideline-concordant care. Treatment analyses compared AI/ANs with matched whites. RESULTS: Across cancer types, AI/ANs were less likely to receive optimal cancer treatment and were less likely to undergo surgery (P </= .025 for all cancers). Adjuvant therapy rates were significantly lower for AI/AN patients with breast cancer (P < .001) and colon cancer (P = .001). Rates of post-treatment surveillance also were lower among AI/ANs and were statistically significantly lower for AI/AN patients with breast cancer (P = .002) and prostate cancer (P < .001). Nonreceipt of optimal cancer treatment was associated with significantly worse survival across cancer types. Disease-specific survival for those who did not undergo surgery was significantly lower for patients with breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.62), colon cancer (HR, 0.74), prostate cancer (HR, 0.52), and lung cancer (HR, 0.36). Survival rates also were significantly lower for those patients who did not receive adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (HR, 0.56), colon cancer (HR, 0.59), or prostate cancer (HR, 0.81; all 95% confidence intervals were <1.0). CONCLUSIONS: Fewer AI/AN patients than white patients received guideline-concordant cancer treatment across the 4 most common cancers. Efforts to explain these differences are critical to improving cancer care and survival for AI/AN patients.

CONCORD is a programme for the global surveillance of cancer survival. In 2015, the second cycle of the program (CONCORD-2) established long-term surveillance of cancer survival worldwide, for the first time, in the largest cancer survival study published to date. CONCORD-2 provided cancer survival trends for 25,676,887 patients diagnosed during the 15-year period between 1995 and 2009 with 1 of 10 common cancers that collectively represented 63% of the global cancer burden in 2009. Herein, the authors summarize the past, describe the present, and outline the future of the CONCORD programme. They discuss the difference between population-based studies and clinical trials, and review the importance of international comparisons of population-based cancer survival. This study will focus on the United States. The authors explain why population-based survival estimates are crucial for driving effective cancer control strategies to reduce the wide and persistent disparities in cancer survival between white and black patients, which are likely to be attributable to differences in access to early diagnosis and optimal treatment.

Human papillomavirus (HPV) causes greater than 5% of cancers worldwide, including all cervical cancers and an alarmingly increasing proportion of oropharyngeal cancers (OPCs). Despite markedly reduced cervical cancer incidence in industrialized nations with organized screening programs, cervical cancer remains the second most common cause of death from cancer in women worldwide, as developing countries lack resources for universal, high-quality screening. In the United States, HPV-related OPC is only 1 of 5 cancers with a rising incidence since 1975 and now has taken over the cervix as the most common site of HPV-related cancer. Similar trends follow throughout North America and Europe. The need for early detection and prevention is paramount. Despite the common etiologic role of HPV in the development of cervical cancer and HPV-associated OPC, great disparity exists between incidence, screening modalities (or lack thereof), treatment, and prevention in these 2 very distinct cohorts. These differences in cervical cancer and HPV-associated OPC and their impact are discussed here. Cancer 2017;123:2219-2229. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate annually to provide updates on cancer incidence and death rates and trends in these outcomes for the United States. This year's report includes the prevalence of comorbidity at the time of first cancer diagnosis among patients with lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer and survival among cancer patients based on comorbidity level. METHODS: Data on cancer incidence were obtained from the NCI, the CDC, and the NAACCR; and data on mortality were obtained from the CDC. Long-term (1975/1992-2010) and short-term (2001-2010) trends in age-adjusted incidence and death rates for all cancers combined and for the leading cancers among men and women were examined by joinpoint analysis. Through linkage with Medicare claims, the prevalence of comorbidity among cancer patients who were diagnosed between 1992 through 2005 residing in 11 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) areas were estimated and compared with the prevalence in a 5% random sample of cancer-free Medicare beneficiaries. Among cancer patients, survival and the probabilities of dying of their cancer and of other causes by comorbidity level, age, and stage were calculated. RESULTS: Death rates continued to decline for all cancers combined for men and women of all major racial and ethnic groups and for most major cancer sites; rates for both sexes combined decreased by 1.5% per year from 2001 through 2010. Overall incidence rates decreased in men and stabilized in women. The prevalence of comorbidity was similar among cancer-free Medicare beneficiaries (31.8%), breast cancer patients (32.2%), and prostate cancer patients (30.5%); highest among lung cancer patients (52.9%); and intermediate among colorectal cancer patients (40.7%). Among all cancer patients and especially for patients diagnosed with local and regional disease, age and comorbidity level were important influences on the probability of dying of other causes and, consequently, on overall survival. For patients diagnosed with distant disease, the probability of dying of cancer was much higher than the probability of dying of other causes, and age and comorbidity had a smaller effect on overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer death rates in the United States continue to decline. Estimates of survival that include the probability of dying of cancer and other causes stratified by comorbidity level, age, and stage can provide important information to facilitate treatment decisions.

BACKGROUND: Data on the incidence of adverse liver outcomes are limited for cancer patients with chronic (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]-positive/hepatitis B core antibody [anti-HBc]-positive) or past (HBsAg-negative/anti-HBc-positive) hepatitis B virus (HBV) after chemotherapy. This study was aimed at determining the impact of test timing and anti-HBV therapy on adverse liver outcomes in these patients. METHODS: Patients with solid or hematologic malignancies who received chemotherapy between 2004 and 2011 were retrospectively studied. HBV testing and anti-HBV therapy were defined as early at the initiation of cancer therapy and as late after initiation. Outcomes included hepatitis flares, hepatic impairment, liver failure, and death. Time-to-event analysis was used to determine incidence, and multivariate hazard models were used to determine predictors of outcomes. RESULTS: There were 18,688 study patients (80.4% with solid tumors). The prevalence of chronic HBV was 1.1% (52 of 4905), and the prevalence of past HBV was 7.1% (350 of 4905). Among patients with solid tumors, late identification of chronic HBV was associated with a higher risk of hepatitis flare (hazard ratio [HR], 4.02; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.26-12.86), hepatic impairment (HR, 8.48; 95% CI, 1.86-38.66), liver failure (HR, 9.38; 95% CI, 1.50-58.86), and death (HR, 3.90; 95% CI, 1.19-12.83) in comparison with early identification. Among patients with hematologic malignancies and chronic HBV, the risk of death was 7.8 (95% CI, 1.73-35.27) times higher for persons with late initiation of anti-HBV therapy versus early initiation. Patients with late identification of chronic HBV had late or no anti-HBV therapy. Chronic HBV predicted liver failure in patients with solid or hematologic malignancies, whereas male sex and late identification were predictors for patients with solid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification correlates with early anti-HBV therapy and reduces the risk of liver failure and death in chronic HBV patients receiving chemotherapy. Cancer 2017;123:3367-76.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: The presence of specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be used to calculate an individual's risk for colorectal cancer (CRC), called a genetic risk score (GRS). We investigated whether GRS can identify individuals with clinically relevant neoplasms in a screening colonoscopy population. METHODS: We derived a GRS based on 48 SNPs associated with CRC, identified in a comprehensive literature search. We obtained genetic data from 1043 participants (50-79 years old) in a screening colonoscopy study in Germany, recruited from 2005 through 2013 (294 with advanced neoplasms, 249 with non-advanced adenoma (NAAs), and 500 without neoplasms). Each participant was assigned a GRS by aggregating their risk alleles (0, 1, or 2). Risk of advanced neoplasms and NAA according to GRS was calculated by multiple logistic regression. Risk advancement periods were calculated. We replicated our findings using data from a subset of the Tennessee Colorectal Polyp Study. RESULTS: An increased GRS was associated with higher prevalence of advanced neoplasms, but not NAAs. Participants in the middle and upper tertiles of GRS had a 2.2-fold and 2.7-fold increase in risk, respectively, of advanced neoplasms compared to those in the lower tertile. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were 1.09 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.76-1.57) for NAA in the middle tertile and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.70-1.55) for NAA in the upper tertile. The ORs were largest for proximal advanced neoplasms for participants in the middle tertile (OR, 3.55; 95% CI 1.85-6.82) and the upper tertile (OR, 3.61; 95% CI 1.84-7.10). The risk advancement period for medium vs low GRS was 13.4 years (95% CI 4.8-22.0) and for high vs low GRS was 17.5 years (95% CI, 7.8-27.3). CONCLUSIONS: In a genetic analysis of participants in a CRC screening study in Germany, an increased GRS (based on CRC-associated SNPs) was associated with increased prevalence of advanced neoplasms. These findings might be used in defining risk-adapted screening ages.

PURPOSE: Survivors of childhood cancer have an increased risk for subsequent neoplasms (SNs), but the incidence beyond the age of 40 years and associations with therapeutic exposures have not been well described. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Among 14,364 survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1986, 3,171 had an attained age of 40 years or older at the time of last contact. Cumulative incidence of SNs, standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), excess absolute risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMNs), and relative risks (RRs) for SMNs and nonmelanoma skin cancers were calculated. RESULTS: In total, 679 SNs were diagnosed in patients age 40 years or older. These included 196 SMNs, 419 nonmelanoma skin cancers, 21 nonmalignant meningiomas, and 43 other benign neoplasms. At age 55 years, the cumulative incidence of new SNs and SMNs occurring after age 40 years was 34.6% (95% CI, 28.7 to 40.6) and 16.3% (95% CI, 11.7 to 20.9), respectively. Survivors were twice as likely as the general population to receive a diagnosis of SMN after age 40 years (SIR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.9 to 2.5). Among SMNs, risk was increased for breast cancer (SIR, 5.5; 95% CI, 4.5 to 6.7), renal cancer (SIR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.0 to 7.5), soft tissue sarcoma (SIR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.5 to 4.4), and thyroid cancer (SIR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.0 to 3.5). Female sex (RR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.6; P < .001) and therapeutic radiation exposure (RR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 3.3; P < .001) were associated with an increased for risk for SMN in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: Even after age 40 years, survivors of childhood cancer remain at increased risk for treatment-related SNs. These data suggest the need for life-long monitoring and should inform anticipatory guidance provided to survivors of childhood cancer.

BACKGROUND: In the current study, the authors attempted to describe the incidence, most common sites, and mortality of second primary malignancies among survivors of common cancers. METHODS: The authors identified patients aged >/=18 years who were diagnosed with a primary malignancy from the 10 most common cancer sites (prostate, breast, lung, colon, rectum, bladder, uterus, kidney, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma) between 1992 and 2008 from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. Factors associated with the incidence of second primary malignancies were explored using bivariable and multivariable models, and mortality attributable to first and second primary malignancies was examined. RESULTS: A cohort of 2,116,163 patients was identified, 170,865 of whom (8.1%) developed a second primary malignancy. Survivors of bladder cancer had the highest risk of developing a second cancer. In a multivariable model controlling for age, race, tumor grade, stage of disease, marital status, educational level, and income, a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratios of 2.70 and 2.88, respectively, for men and women) and bladder cancer (hazard ratios of 1.88 and 1.66, respectively, for men and women) predicted the highest risk of developing a second cancer. For patients with 2 incident cancers, 13% died of their initial cancer, but greater than one-half (55%) died of their second primary malignancy. Lung cancer was the cause of death in 12% of patients with 2 incident cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 1 in 12 patients diagnosed with a common cancer developed a second malignancy, the most common of which was lung cancer. Greater than one-half of patients with 2 incident cancers died of their secondary malignancy. The findings from the current study may inform care strategies among cancer survivors.

BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to examine associations between childhood cancer therapies, chronic health conditions, and symptoms of emotional distress in adult survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: Participants included 5021 adult survivors of childhood cancer (mean age, 32.0 years [standard deviation, 7.6 years] with a time since diagnosis of 23.2 years [standard deviation, 4.5 years]) who completed measures assessing symptoms of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress. Cardiac, pulmonary, and endocrine conditions were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03; grades 1-4). Structural equation modeling was used to examine hypothesized pathways between cancer treatment exposures, chronic health conditions, and symptoms of emotional distress. Multivariable models were used to estimate relative risks (RRs) for associations between chronic health conditions and distress. RESULTS: Survivors with cardiovascular, endocrine, or pulmonary conditions were found to have a significantly higher prevalence of emotional distress symptoms. In path analyses and multivariable models, significant effects were observed between endocrine (beta = .12 [P = .002] and RR, 1.3 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.1-1.6]) and pulmonary (beta = .13 [P<.001] and RR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.7]) conditions and depression, and between cardiac (beta = .13 [P = .001] and RR, 1.5 [95% CI, 1.2-1.8]) and pulmonary (beta = .15 [P<.001] and RR, 1.6 [95% CI, 1.3-2.0]) conditions and anxiety. All treatment-related chronic health conditions were found to be associated with posttraumatic stress symptoms (cardiac: beta = .09 [P = .004] and RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.5]; endocrine: beta = .12 [P<.001] and RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.2-1.5]; and pulmonary: beta = .13 [P<.001] and RR, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.2-1.6]). CONCLUSIONS: Chronic health conditions resulting from childhood cancer therapies contribute to emotional distress in adult survivors. Targeted mental health screening efforts in this at-risk population appear warranted. Therapeutic approaches should consider the complex interplay between chronic health conditions and symptoms of emotional distress. Cancer 2017;123:521-528. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is one of the most common cancer predisposing syndromes with an incidence of 1 in 3,500 worldwide. Certain neoplasms or malignancies are over-represented in individuals with NF1; however, an increased risk of breast cancer has not been widely recognized or accepted. We identified 76 women with NF1 seen in the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) from 1990 to 2009, and linked them to the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry covering the metropolitan Detroit area. Fifty-one women (67%) were under age 50 years at the time of data analysis. Six women developed invasive breast cancer before age 50, and three developed invasive breast cancer after age 50. Using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) calculated based on the SEER age-adjusted invasive breast cancer incidence rates, our findings demonstrated a statistically significant increase of breast cancer incidence occurring in NF1 women (SIR = 5.2; 95% CI 2.4-9.8), and this relative increase was especially evident among those with breast cancer onset under age 50 (SIR = 8.8; 95% CI 3.2-19.2). These data are consistent with other reports suggesting an increase in breast cancer risk among females with NF1, which indicate that breast cancer screening guidelines should be evaluated for this potentially high-risk group.

Because cancer registry data provide a census of cancer cases, registry data can be used to: 1) define and monitor cancer incidence at the local, state, and national levels; 2) investigate patterns of cancer treatment; and 3) evaluate the effectiveness of public health efforts to prevent cancer cases and improve cancer survival. The purpose of this article is to provide a broad overview of the history of cancer surveillance programs in the United States, and illustrate the expanding ways in which cancer surveillance data are being made available and contributing to cancer control programs. The article describes the building of the cancer registry infrastructure and the successful coordination of efforts among the 2 federal agencies that support cancer registry programs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Cancer Institute, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. The major US cancer control programs also are described, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program, the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, and the Colorectal Cancer Control Program. This overview illustrates how cancer registry data can inform public health actions to reduce disparities in cancer outcomes and may be instructional for a variety of cancer control professionals in the United States and in other countries.

BACKGROUND: Although state Medicaid programs cover cancer screening, Medicaid beneficiaries are less likely to be screened for cancer and are more likely to present with tumors of an advanced stage than are those with other insurance. The current study was performed to determine whether state Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement policies affect the receipt of breast, cervical, and colon cancer screening among Medicaid beneficiaries. METHODS: Cross-sectional regression analyses of 2007 Medicaid data from 46 states and the District of Columbia were performed to examine associations between state-specific Medicaid reimbursement/eligibility policies and receipt of cancer screening. The study sample included individuals aged 21 years to 64 years who were enrolled in fee-for-service Medicaid for at least 4 months. Subsamples eligible for each screening test were: Papanicolaou test among 2,136,511 patients, mammography among 792,470 patients, colonoscopy among 769,729 patients, and fecal occult blood test among 753,868 patients. State-specific Medicaid variables included median screening test reimbursement, income/financial asset eligibility requirements, physician copayments, and frequency of eligibility renewal. RESULTS: Increases in screening test reimbursement demonstrated mixed associations (positive and negative) with the likelihood of receiving screening tests among Medicaid beneficiaries. In contrast, increased reimbursements for office visits were found to be positively associated with the odds of receiving all screening tests examined, including colonoscopy (odds ratio [OR], 1.07; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.06-1.08), fecal occult blood test (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 1.08-1.10), Papanicolaou test (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03), and mammography (OR, 1.02; 95% CI, 1.02-1.03). Effects of other state-specific Medicaid policies varied across the screening tests examined. CONCLUSIONS: Increased reimbursement for office visits was consistently associated with an increased likelihood of being screened for cancer, and may be an important policy tool for increasing screening among this vulnerable population.

BACKGROUND: The difficulties adolescents and young adults (AYAs) encounter during a cancer experience may result in a reduction in or absence of empowerment. The aims of the current study were to assess levels of empowerment and associated (demographic, clinical, or psychological) factors and examine the association between empowerment and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among AYA patients with cancer. METHODS: Patients aged 18 to 35 years at time of cancer diagnosis and who were seen by 1 of the members of the specialized multidisciplinary AYA team of the Radboud University Medical Center were invited to complete questionnaires regarding empowerment; HRQOL; and sociodemographic, clinical, and psychological characteristics (autonomy, coping, unmet social support needs, and psychological distress). RESULTS: A total of 83 AYA patients completed the questionnaires. The mean age of the participants at the time of diagnosis was 27.5 years. The vast majority had been treated with chemotherapy (86%), had a more advanced stage of disease, and had completed treatment at the time of participation (74%). The mean empowerment level was 154.1 (standard deviation, 17.8) with a range of 114 to 200. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the autonomy subscales of self-awareness (beta = .35), capacity for managing new situations (beta = .19), and social support (beta = .35) were found to be positively associated with empowerment. Coping difficulties (beta = -.19) were found to be negatively associated with empowerment. Empowerment was independently associated with physical (beta = .31), psychological (beta = .50), social (beta = .39), religious (beta = .33), and total HRQOL (beta = .52; all P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: Low levels of empowerment were associated with low levels of autonomy and social support, female sex, and coping difficulties among AYA patients with cancer. Recognizing these patients as candidates for empowerment interventions ultimately could help to improve HRQOL in late adolescence and young adulthood. Cancer 2017;123:4039-47. (c) 2017 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Out-of-pocket expenditures are thought to be an important barrier to the receipt of cancer preventive services, especially for those of a lower socioeconomic status (SES). The Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated out-of-pocket expenditures for recommended services, including mammography and colonoscopy. The objective of this study was to determine changes in the uptake of mammography and colonoscopy among fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries before and after ACA implementation. METHODS: Using Medicare claims data, this study identified women who were 70 years old or older and had not undergone mammography in the previous 2 years and men and women who were 70 years old or older, were at increased risk for colorectal cancer, and had not undergone colonoscopy in the past 5 years. The receipt of procedures in the 2-year period before the ACA's implementation (2009-2010) and after its implementation (2011 to September 2012) was also identified. Multivariate generalized estimating equation models were used to determine the independent association and county-level quartile of median income and education with the receipt of testing. RESULTS: For mammography, a lower SES quartile was associated with less uptake, but the post-ACA disparities were smaller than those in the pre-ACA period. In addition, mammography rates increased from the pre-ACA period to the post-ACA period in all SES quartiles. For colonoscopy, in both the pre- and post-ACA periods, there was an association between uptake and educational level and, to some extent, income. However, there were no appreciable changes in colonoscopy and SES after implementation of the ACA. CONCLUSIONS: The removal of out-of-pocket expenditures may overcome a barrier to the receipt of recommended preventive services, but for colonoscopy, other procedural factors may remain as deterrents.

BACKGROUND: Satellite facilities of National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer centers have expanded their regional footprints. This study characterized geographic access to parent and satellite NCI cancer center facilities nationally overall and by sociodemographics. METHODS: Parent and satellite NCI cancer center facilities, which were geocoded in ArcGIS, were ascertained. Travel times from every census tract in the continental United States and Hawaii to the nearest parent and satellite facilities were calculated. Census-based population attributes were used to characterize measures of geographic access for sociodemographic groups. RESULTS: From the 62 NCI cancer centers providing clinical care in 2014, 76 unique parent locations and 211 satellite locations were mapped. The overall proportion of the population within 60 minutes of a facility was 22% for parent facilities and 32.7% for satellite facilities. When satellites were included for potential access, the proportion of some racial groups for which a satellite was the closest NCI cancer center facility increased notably (Native Americans, 22.6% with parent facilities and 39.7% with satellite facilities; whites, 34.8% with parent facilities and 50.3% with satellite facilities; and Asians, 40.0% with parent facilities and 54.0% with satellite facilities), with less marked increases for Hispanic and black populations. Rural populations of all categories had dramatically low proportions living within 60 minutes of an NCI cancer center facility of any type (1.0%-6.6%). Approximately 14% of the population (n = 43,033,310) lived more than 180 minutes from a parent or satellite facility, and most of these individuals were Native Americans and/or rural residents (37% of Native Americans and 41.7% of isolated rural residents). CONCLUSIONS: Racial/ethnic and rural populations showed markedly improved geographic access to NCI cancer center care when satellite facilities were included. Cancer 2017;123:3305-11.

BACKGROUND: While there are validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) instruments for use in specific cancer populations, no validated general instruments exist for use in conditions common to multiple cancers, such as muscle wasting and consequent physical disability. The Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey (MCBS), a survey in a nationally representative sample of Medicare beneficiaries, includes items from three well known scales with general applicability to cancer patients: Katz activities of daily living (ADL), Rosow-Breslau instrumental ADL (IADL), and a subset of physical performance items from the Nagi scale. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated properties of the Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and a subset of the Nagi scale in patients with pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) using data from MCBS linked with Medicare claims in order to understand the potential utility of the three scales in these populations; understanding patient-perceived significance was not in scope. METHODS: The study cohorts included Medicare beneficiaries aged >/=65 years as of 1 January of the year of their first cancer diagnosis with one or more health assessments in a community setting in the MCBS Access to Care data from 1991 to 2009. Beneficiaries had at least two diagnoses in de-identified Medicare claims data linked to the MCBS for one of the following cancers: pancreatic, lung, or MPN. The Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales were calculated to assess physical functioning over time from cancer diagnosis. Psychometric properties for each scale in each cohort were evaluated by testing for internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and responsiveness by comparing differences in mean scale scores over time as cancer progresses, and differences in mean scale scores before and after hospitalization (for lung cancer cohort). RESULTS: The study cohorts included 90 patients with pancreatic cancer, 863 with lung cancer, and 135 with MPN. Among each cancer cohort, the Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha generally between 0.70 and 0.90) and test-retest reliability for consecutive surveys before diagnosis and consecutive surveys after diagnosis (when patients' functioning was more stable). Compared with mean scale scores at the survey 1-2 years before cancer diagnosis (baseline), mean scale scores at the first survey after cancer diagnosis were significantly higher (P < 0.05), indicating worsening, for Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales (items scored 0-1) (0.54 vs. 1.45, 1.15 vs. 2.20, and 2.29 vs. 3.08, respectively, for pancreatic cancer; 0.73 vs. 1.24, 1.29 vs. 2.01, and 2.41 vs. 2.85 for lung cancer; and 0.44 vs. 0.86, 0.87 vs. 1.36, and 1.87 vs. 2.32 for MPN). Among lung cancer patients, scale scores increased significantly following a hospitalization, suggesting a worsening of functional status. CONCLUSIONS: The Katz ADL, Rosow-Breslau IADL, and Nagi scales collected in the MCBS demonstrate acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability among patients with pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, and MPN, and are consistent with clinical worsening following diagnosis or hospitalization. These results suggest that using retrospective data may allow researchers to conduct preliminary assessments of existing PRO instruments in new populations of interest and generate useful exploratory disease information before embarking on de novo PRO development.

PURPOSE: When it comes to cancer care, the psychological well-being of family caregivers has gotten its deserved attention. However, the specific roles that the family caregivers take have not been examined as much. The current study aimed to investigate the distribution of family caregivers' roles, particularly in a family-oriented culture, Korea. Materials and Methods: A sample of 439 participants was recruited from 11 national and regional cancer centers in Korea. The participants who were 60 years old or above went through treatments for their gastric, colorectal, or lung cancer. The individual survey included questions regarding the family type, living arrangement, and the sources of support when it comes to their physical, emotional, financial, and decision-making needs. RESULTS: The responses from the participants showed that cancer caregiving is shared by multiple family caregivers; the major source of support for elderly cancer patients on diverse domains was their spouse; patients' reliance on their daughter(s) increased for emotional support; and patients' reliance on their son(s) stood out for financial support and decision-making support. Also, the older the patients were, the heavier their reliance was on the adult children, including sons, daughters, and daughters-in-law. CONCLUSION: Future support programs for elderly cancer patients are suggested to involve multiple family caregivers to encourage effective and efficient intervention. Also, the limitations of the current study and the suggestions for future research are discussed.

Objective: To analyze the age distribution characteristics of different cancers in the world according to the database from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents published by the International Association of Cancer Registries, and to compare the age differences of cancer incidence in different regions. Methods: Cancer incidence data from volume XI of Cancer Incidence in Five Continents including 339 population-based cancer registries in 65 countries during 2008-2012 have been extracted. The average age of cancer incidence in different regions, gender and cancer sites were analyzed and stratified according to the human development Index and the level of national or regional development UN Development. The Segi's world standard population (world standard) was standardized to calculate the average age of the cancer incidence and to analyze the effect of age structure of the population on the average age of cancer diagnosis. Results: This study included 4 812 008 148 person-years in the global population (including 2 367 458 302 men and 2 444 549 846 women), and 21 892 093 of the new cancer cases, including 11 450 515 men and 10 441 578 women. The analysis showed that the average age of cancer incidence in the world was 65.73 years, and men and women were 66.70 and 64.67 years old, respectively. Among them, the average incidence age of testicular cancer was the youngest, with an average age of 36.67 years, and that of gallbladder cancer was the highest with average age of 71.55 years. After adjusting for population structure, the average incidence age was highest in gallbladder cancer, followed with bladder cancer and prostate cancer, and the testicular was with the lowest average age of incidence, followed by bone cancer and brain tumor. The results showed that the average age of cancer incidence in developed countries or regions was 66.38 years old, and that in less developed countries or regions was 61.75 years old, but in China it was 63.47 years old. According to the human development index (HDI), the higher the country or region with HDI, the higher the average age of cancer incidence, and the difference is reduced after the adjustment of the age structure of the population. Conclusions: There are different characteristics of the age distribution for different cancer sites. In terms of the age of cancer incidence, those of gallbladder cancer and bladder cancer are relatively old, while those of the testis, bone and thyroid cancer are relatively young. The average age of cancer incidence in China is between developed and less developed countries. Prevention and control of cancer should be carried out according to the age distribution characteristics of different cancers.

BACKGROUND: Genetic testing to determine cancer survivors' risk of developing late effects from their cancer treatment will be increasingly used in survivorship care. This 2-stage study with 64 survivors of childhood cancer and their parents investigated the preferences and acceptability of testing among those who may be at risk of developing late effects. METHODS: The first stage (Stage 1) identified the most commonly perceived benefits and concerns regarding genetic testing for the risk of late effects among 24 participants. In Stage 2, during interviews, 20 survivors (55% of whom were female; mean age, 26.0 years [range, 18-39 years]; standard deviation [SD], 0.80) and 20 parents (55% of whom were male; mean age of child survivor, 14.2 years [range, 10-19 years]; SD, 0.79) rated the 7 most common benefits and concerns from those identified in Stage 1. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed. Decisional balance ratios were calculated by dividing the participants' average concerns scores with the average benefits scores. RESULTS: Genetic testing for late effects was highly acceptable: 95% of participants leaned toward testing, and the majority (65.9%) would pay up to Australian $5000. The majority (97.2%) reported it was acceptable to wait for up to 6 months to receive results, and to be offered testing immediately after treatment or when the survivor reached adulthood (62.9%). Survivors and parents had a highly positive decisional balance (Mean (M), 0.5 [SD, 0.38] and M, 0.5 [SD, 0.39], respectively), indicating that perceived benefits outweighed concerns. CONCLUSIONS: Although to our knowledge clinical efficacy has yet to be clearly demonstrated, survivors and parents described positive interest in genetic testing for the risk of developing late effects. Perceived benefits outweighed harms, and the majority of participants would be willing to pay, and wait, for testing. Cancer 2016. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society. Cancer 2016;122:2876-2885.

CONTEXT: Survivors of childhood cancer are at excess risk of developing subsequent primary neoplasms but the long-term risks are uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To investigate long-term risks of subsequent primary neoplasms in survivors of childhood cancer, to identify the types that contribute most to long-term excess risk, and to identify subgroups of survivors at substantially increased risk of particular subsequent primary neoplasms that may require specific interventions. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: British Childhood Cancer Survivor Study--a population-based cohort of 17,981 5-year survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed with cancer at younger than 15 years between 1940 and 1991 in Great Britain, followed up through December 2006. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), absolute excess risks (AERs), and cumulative incidence of subsequent primary neoplasms. RESULTS: After a median follow-up time of 24.3 years (mean = 25.6 years), 1354 subsequent primary neoplasms were ascertained; the most frequently observed being central nervous system (n = 344), nonmelanoma skin cancer (n = 278), digestive (n = 105), genitourinary (n = 100), breast (n = 97), and bone (n = 94). The overall SIR was 4 times more than expected (SIR, 3.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-4.2; AER, 16.8 per 10,000 person-years). The AER at older than 40 years was highest for digestive and genitourinary subsequent primary neoplasms (AER, 5.9 [95% CI, 2.5-9.3]; and AER, 6.0 [95%CI, 2.3-9.6] per 10,000 person-years, respectively); 36% of the total AER was attributable to these 2 subsequent primary neoplasm sites. The cumulative incidence of colorectal cancer for survivors treated with direct abdominopelvic irradiation was 1.4% (95% CI, 0.7%-2.6%) by age 50 years, comparable with the 1.2% risk in individuals with at least 2 first-degree relatives affected by colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Among a cohort of British childhood cancer survivors, the greatest excess risk associated with subsequent primary neoplasms at older than 40 years was for digestive and genitourinary neoplasms.

BACKGROUND: After a pilot study on skin cancer screening was performed between 2003 and 2004 in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, the country implemented what to the authors' knowledge is the first nationwide skin cancer screening program in the world in 2008. The objective of the current study was to provide details regarding mortality trends in Schleswig-Holstein and Germany in relation to the screening. METHODS: Annual age-standardized mortality rates for skin melanoma (using the 10th Revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems [ICD-10] code C43) and malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary, and unspecified sites (ICD-10 code C76-C80) were analyzed. The European Standard population was used for age standardization. A bias analysis was performed to estimate the number of skin melanoma deaths that may have been incorrectly counted as ICD-10 code C76-C80 when the skin melanoma mortality declined in Schleswig-Holstein. RESULTS: The observed mortality decline in Schleswig-Holstein 5 years after the pilot study was accompanied by a considerable increase in the number of deaths due to malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary, and unspecified sites (ICD-10 code C76-C80) that is not explainable by an increase in the incidence of these neoplasms. Incorrect assignment of 8 to 35 and 12 to 23 skin melanoma deaths per year among men and women, respectively, as ICD-10 code C76-C80 during 2007 through 2010 could explain the transient skin melanoma mortality decline observed in Schleswig-Holstein. Five years after implementation of the program, the nationwide skin melanoma mortality increased (age-standardized rate change of +0.4 per 100,000 person-years [95% confidence interval, 0.2-0.6] in men and +0.1 per 100,000 person-years [95% confidence interval, -0.1 to 0.2] in women). CONCLUSIONS: Although the current analyses raise doubts that the skin cancer screening program in Germany can reduce the skin cancer mortality rate, the authors do not believe the program should be immediately stopped. Further in-depth evaluations are required. Cancer 2016;122:432-437. (c) 2015 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to investigate the utility and clinical impact of second-opinion interpretations of outside neuroimaging studies by oncologic neuroradiologists at a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of initial outside and second-opinion radiology reports from 300 computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging studies and identified cases with discrepancies between the two reports. An adult neuro-oncologist, pediatric neuro-oncologist, and head and neck surgeon reviewed each pair of discrepant reports based on their area of expertise, patient age, and the type of study performed. The clinicians were blinded to the origin of each report and recorded whether the differences in the reports would have led to a change in patient management and/or disease staging. Histopathologic analysis, clinical assessment, and/or minimum 3-month imaging follow-up served as the reference standards to establish which of the 2 reports was correct. RESULTS: Among the 283 cases that met our study criteria, there were 55 neuroimaging studies with disagreements (19%) between the initial outside report and second-opinion interpretation. Patient management and/or disease stage would have been altered in 42 of 283 cases (15%) based on report differences as determined by the 2 neuro-oncologists and the surgeon participating in the study. Sufficient follow-up was available in 35 of 42 cases (83%). The second-opinion interpretation was correct 100% of the time (35/35). CONCLUSION: Second-opinion interpretations of neuroimaging studies by subspecialized oncologic neuroradiologists provide added value by reducing error and optimizing the care of cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are less likely to receive cancer treatment compared with HIV-uninfected individuals. However, to the authors' knowledge, the impact of insurance status and comorbidities is unknown. METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Data Base were used to study nonelderly adults diagnosed with several common cancers from 2003 to 2011. Cancer treatment was defined as chemotherapy, surgery, radiotherapy, or any combination during the first course of treatment. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine associations between HIV status and lack of cancer treatment, and identify predictors for lack of treatment among HIV-infected patients. RESULTS: A total of 10,265 HIV-infected and 2,219,232 HIV-uninfected cases were included. In multivariate analysis, HIV-infected patients with cancer were found to be more likely to lack cancer treatment for cancers of the head and neck (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.48; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.09-2.01), upper gastrointestinal tract (aOR, 2.62; 95% CI, 2.04-3.37), colorectum (aOR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.17-2.48), lung (aOR, 2.46; 95% CI, 2.19-2.76), breast (aOR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.16-3.98), cervix (aOR, 2.81; 95% CI, 1.77-4.45), prostate (aOR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.69-2.76), Hodgkin lymphoma (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.66-2.22), and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (aOR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.65-2.00). Predictors of a lack of cancer treatment among HIV-infected individuals varied by tumor type (solid tumor vs lymphoma), but black race and a lack of private insurance were found to be predictors for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: In the United States, HIV-infected patients with cancer appear to be less likely to receive cancer treatment regardless of insurance and comorbidities. To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the largest study of cancer treatment in HIV-infected patients with cancer in the United States and provides evidence of cancer treatment disparities even after controlling for differences with regard to insurance status and comorbidities. Further work should focus on addressing differential cancer treatment. Cancer 2016;122:2399-2407. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Metastatic lesions in prostate cancer beyond the bone have prognostic importance and affect clinical therapeutic decisions. Few data exist regarding the prevalence of soft-tissue metastases at the initial diagnosis of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). METHODS: This study analyzed 232 men with nonmetastatic (M0) castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) who developed metastases detected by a bone scan or computed tomography (CT). All bone scans and CT scans within the 30 days before or after the mCRPC diagnosis were reviewed. The rate of soft-tissue metastases among those undergoing CT was determined. Then, predictors of soft-tissue metastases and visceral and lymph node metastases were identified. RESULTS: Compared with men undergoing CT (n = 118), men undergoing only bone scans (n = 114) were more likely to have received primary treatment (P = .048), were older (P = .013), and less recently developed metastases (P = .018). Among those undergoing CT, 52 (44%) had soft-tissue metastases, including 20 visceral metastases (17%) and 41 lymph node metastases (35%), whereas 30% had no bone involvement. In a univariable analysis, only prostate-specific antigen (PSA) predicted soft-tissue metastases (odds ratio [OR], 1.27; P = .047), and no statistically significant predictors of visceral metastases were found. A higher PSA level was associated with an increased risk of lymph node metastases (OR, 1.38; P = .014), whereas receiving primary treatment was associated with decreased risk (OR, 0.36; P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that there is a relatively high rate of soft-tissue metastasis (44%) among CRPC patients undergoing CT at the initial diagnosis of metastases, including some men with no bone involvement. Therefore, forgoing CT during a metastatic evaluation may lead to an underdiagnosis of soft-tissue metastases and an underdiagnosis of metastases in general. Cancer 2015.

Financial burden from cancer treatment is increasingly being recognized as a threat to optimal access, quality, and outcomes of cancer care for patients. Although research in the area is moving at a fast pace, multiple questions remain unanswered, such as how to practically integrate the assessment and management of financial burden into routine health care delivery for patients with cancer. Although psychological distress screening for patients undergoing cancer treatment now is commonplace, the authors raise the provocative idea of universal screening for financial distress to identify and assist vulnerable groups of patients. Herein, the authors outline the arguments to support screening for financial burden in addition to psychological distress, examining it as an independent patient-reported outcome for all patients with cancer at various time points during their treatment. The authors describe the proximal and downstream impact of such a strategy and reflect on some challenges and potential solutions to help integrate this concept into routine cancer care delivery.

BACKGROUND: Both the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) Hospital Compare star rating and surgical case volume have been publicized as metrics that can help patients to identify high-quality hospitals for complex care such as cancer surgery. The current study evaluates the relationship between the CMS' star rating, surgical volume, and short-term outcomes after major cancer surgery. METHODS: National Medicare data were used to evaluate the relationship between hospital star ratings and cancer surgery volume quintiles. Then, multilevel logistic regression models were fit to examine the association between cancer surgery outcomes and both star rankings and surgical volumes. Lastly, a graphical approach was used to compare how well star ratings and surgical volume predicted cancer surgery outcomes. RESULTS: This study identified 365,752 patients undergoing major cancer surgery for 1 of 9 cancer types at 2,550 hospitals. Star rating was not associated with surgical volume (P < .001). However, both the star rating and surgical volume were correlated with 4 short-term cancer surgery outcomes (mortality, complication rate, readmissions, and prolonged length of stay). The adjusted predicted probabilities for 5- and 1-star hospitals were 2.3% and 4.5% for mortality, 39% and 48% for complications, 10% and 15% for readmissions, and 8% and 16% for a prolonged length of stay, respectively. The adjusted predicted probabilities for hospitals with the highest and lowest quintile cancer surgery volumes were 2.7% and 5.8% for mortality, 41% and 55% for complications, 12.2% and 11.6% for readmissions, and 9.4% and 13% for a prolonged length of stay, respectively. Furthermore, surgical volume and the star rating were similarly associated with mortality and complications, whereas the star rating was more highly associated with readmissions and prolonged length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of other information, these findings suggest that the star rating may be useful to patients when they are selecting a hospital for major cancer surgery. However, more research is needed before these ratings can supplant surgical volume as a measure of surgical quality. Cancer 2017;123:4259-4267. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in pure urothelial bladder cancer provides a significant survival benefit. However, to the authors' knowledge, it is unknown whether this benefit persists in histological variants. The objective of the current study was to assess the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the probability of non-organ-confined disease and overall survival after radical cystectomy (RC) in patients with histological variants. METHODS: Querying the National Cancer Data Base, the authors identified 2018 patients with histological variants who were undergoing RC for bladder cancer between 2003 and 2012. Variants were categorized as micropapillary or sarcomatoid differentiation, squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors, and other histology. Logistic regression models estimated the odds of non-organ-confined disease at the time of RC for each histological variant, stratified by the receipt of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cox regression models were used to examine the effect of neoadjuvant chemotherapy on overall mortality in each variant subgroup. RESULTS: Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (odds ratio [OR], 0.16; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.08-0.32 [P<.001]), micropapillary differentiation (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.95 [P=.041]), sarcomatoid urothelial carcinoma (OR, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.17-0.94 [P=.035]), and adenocarcinoma (OR, 0.24; 95% CI, 0.06-0.91 [P=.035]) were less likely to harbor non-organ-confined disease at the time of RC when treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. An overall survival benefit for neoadjuvant chemotherapy was only found in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.33-0.74 [P=.001]). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with neuroendocrine tumors benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as evidenced by better overall survival and lower rates of non-organ-confined disease at the time of RC. For tumors with micropapillary differentiation, sarcomatoid differentiation, or adenocarcinoma, neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreased the frequency of non-organ-confined disease at the time of RC. However, this favorable effect did not translate into a statistically significant overall survival benefit for these patients, potentially due to the aggressive tumor biology.

BACKGROUND: Single-modality radiotherapy is considered a standard-of-care option for certain stage III, T1-2N1 head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs). The role of concomitant chemoradiation is not well established because there have been no studies comparing chemoradiation with radiation alone in this population. METHODS: This study analyzed patients in the National Cancer Data Base with cT1-2N1M0 invasive squamous cell carcinomas of the oropharynx, larynx, and hypopharynx who were diagnosed between 2004 and 2012 and were undergoing definitive radiation. Patients who were undergoing surgery before radiation with unknown follow-up or for whom either the receipt or timing of chemotherapy was unknown were excluded. RESULTS: In all, 5030 patients with T1-2N1 oropharyngeal, laryngeal, or hypopharyngeal cancer were included. The median follow-up was 56.8 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 55.7-58.6 months). Overall, 68% of the patients received concomitant chemoradiation (CCRT). The use of CCRT significantly increased during the time period of this study from 53% in 2004 to 78% in 2012 (P < .001). CCRT was associated with improved overall survival (OS) in comparison with radiation alone in a multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72-0.88; P < .001). In propensity score-adjusted analyses, CCRT remained significantly associated with improved OS, with 5-year OS rates of 63.5% (95% CI, 60.7%-66.2%) and 55.6% (95% CI, 52.7%-58.4%; P < .001) with CCRT and radiation alone, respectively. Subgroup analyses showed a benefit across the majority of subgroups, including patients with oropharyngeal cancer (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.65-0.85; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant chemoradiation is associated with improved survival for patients with T1-2N1 HNSCC. Prospective trials in this population should be pursued. Cancer 2017;123:1555-1565.

BACKGROUND: Routine monitoring of cancer-related distress is recognized as essential to quality care and mandated by a major accrediting organization. However, to the authors' knowledge, few cancer-specific measures have been developed to date to assess the multiple cancer-related factors contributing to this distress. In the current study, the authors examined the psychometric properties of the Cancer and Treatment Distress (CTXD) measure over time in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients. METHODS: As a secondary analysis of a multicenter randomized controlled clinical trial, adult patients undergoing autologous or allogeneic HCT completed patient-reported outcomes including the CTXD and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (SF-36) before transplantation and 100 days and 180 days after HCT. RESULTS: Across 21 transplantation centers, a total of 701 patients consented, underwent transplantation, and were included in the current analyses, 645 of whom were alive at 100 days and 618 of whom were alive at 180 days. Internal consistency reliability was found to be strong for the overall CTXD at the 3 time points: Cronbach alphas (alpha) were .94, .95, and .95, respectively. Subscale reliability met hypothesized levels of an alpha>.70 across time, with the lowest reliability noted for the Identity subscale at 180 days (alpha = .77). Correlations with the SF-36 Mental Health subscale were higher than with the Physical Functioning subscale at each time point, thereby supporting convergent and discriminant validity. Strong correlations of the pretransplantation CTXD with the posttransplantation CTXD and SF-36 Mental Health subscale supported predictive validity. CONCLUSIONS: The CTXD is reliable and valid as a measure of cancer distress both before and after HCT. It may be a useful tool for measuring dimensions of distress and for defining those patients requiring treatment for distress during and after transplantation. Cancer 2017;123:1416-1423.

BACKGROUND: Patient navigation may reduce cancer disparities associated with socioeconomic status (SES) and household factors. This study examined whether these factors were associated with delays in diagnostic resolution among patients with cancer screening abnormalities and whether patient navigation ameliorated these delays. METHODS: This study analyzed data from 5 of 10 centers of the National Cancer Institute's Patient Navigation Research Program, which collected SES and household data on employment, income, education, housing, marital status, and household composition. The primary outcome was the time to diagnostic resolution after a cancer screening abnormality. Separate adjusted Cox proportional hazard models were fit for each SES and household factor, and an interaction between that factor and the intervention status was included. RESULTS: Among the 3777 participants (1968 in the control arm and 1809 in the navigation intervention arm), 91% were women, and the mean age was 44 years; 43% were Hispanic, 28% were white, and 27% were African American. Within the control arm, the unemployed experienced a longer time to resolution than those employed full-time (hazard ratio [HR], 0.85; P = .02). Renters (HR, 0.81; P = .02) and those with other (ie, unstable) housing (HR, 0.60; P < .001) had delays in comparison with homeowners. Never married (HR, 0.70; P < .001) and previously married participants (HR, 0.85; P = .03) had a longer time to care than married participants. There were no differences in the time to diagnostic resolution with any of these variables within the navigation intervention arm. CONCLUSIONS: Delays in diagnostic resolution exist by employment, housing type, and marital status. Patient navigation eliminated these disparities in the study sample. These findings demonstrate the value of providing patient navigation to patients at high risk for delays in cancer care.

BACKGROUND: Physical activity (PA) has been linked to a lower risk of developing and dying of cancer, yet many cancer survivors do not exercise. In the current study, the authors evaluated the impact of the LIVESTRONG at the YMCA exercise program, available at Young Men's Christian Associations (YMCAs) across the United States, on PA, fitness, quality of life, fatigue, body composition, serum biomarkers, and program safety in cancer survivors. METHODS: Cancer survivors were recruited through the Yale Cancer Center and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and randomized to a 12-week, twice-weekly LIVESTRONG at the YMCA exercise program at YMCAs in Connecticut or Massachusetts or to a control group. Questionnaires, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans, 6-minute walk tests (6MWTs), and a fasting blood draw were completed at baseline and at 12 weeks. Intervention effects were evaluated using mixed model repeated measures analysis, with changes at 12 weeks in PA and 6MWT as the primary endpoints. RESULTS: A total of 186 participants were randomized (95 to the exercise group and 91 to the control group). The majority of patients were diagnosed with AJCC stage I to II cancer and 53% had breast cancer. Participants randomized to the LIVESTRONG at the YMCA program experienced increases in PA (71% exercising at >/= 150 minutes/week vs 26% of controls; P<.05) and improvements in the 6MWT (group difference: 28.9 meters [95% confidence interval, 0.3-49.0; P = .004]) and quality of life (group difference: 2.6 [95% confidence interval, 0.1-5.0; P = .04]). No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS: The LIVESTRONG at the YMCA exercise program has the potential to impact thousands of survivors across the YMCA network and could lead to improvements in disease and psychosocial outcomes in the growing population of cancer survivors.

Introduction: One of the most feared complications of childhood cancer treatment is second malignant neoplasms (SMNs). This study evaluates the incidence, risk factors and outcomes of SMNs in a tertiary paediatric oncology centre in Singapore. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review was conducted on patients diagnosed with childhood cancer under age 21 and treated at the National University Hospital, Singapore, from January 1990 to 15 April 2012. Case records of patients with SMNs were reviewed. Results: We identified 1124 cases of childhood cancers with a median follow-up of 3.49 (0 to 24.06) years. The most common primary malignancies were leukaemia (47.1%), central nervous system tumours (11.7%) and lymphoma (9.8%). Fifteen cases developed SMNs, most commonly acute myeloid leukaemia/myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 7). Median interval between the first and second malignancy was 3.41 (0.24 to 18.30) years. Overall 20-year cumulative incidence of SMNs was 5.3% (95% CI, 0.2% to 10.4%). The 15-year cumulative incidence of SMNs following acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was 4.4% (95% CI, 0% to 8.9%), significantly lower than the risk after osteosarcoma of 14.2% (95% CI, 0.7% to 27.7%) within 5 years (P <0.0005). Overall 5-year survival for SMNs was lower than that of primary malignancies. Conclusion: This study identified factors explaining the epidemiology of SMNs described, and found topoisomerase II inhibitor use to be a likely risk factor in our cohort. Modifications have already been made to our existing therapeutic protocols in osteosarcoma treatment. We also recognised the importance of other risk management strategies, including regular long-term surveillance and early intervention for detected SMNs, to improve outcomes of high risk patients.

OBJECTIVE: To compare alternative strategies for specifying cancer-free control cohorts for estimating cancer-attributable costs of care. DATA SOURCE, STUDY DESIGN, DATA EXTRACTION: Secondary data analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data linked to Medicare claims among patients diagnosed with colorectal, lung, breast, and prostate cancers, 2007-2011. We estimated cancer-attributable costs using three alternative reference cohorts: (1) noncancer Medicare patients individually matched by demographic characteristics, (2) noncancer patients individually matched on demographic factors and comorbidity score, (3) cancer patients as their own control, using prediagnosis costs. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 44,266 colorectal, 61,584 lung, 55,921 breast, and 67,733 prostate patients, mean total Medicare spending in the first year of diagnosis was $59,496, $54,261, $31,895, and $26,305, respectively. Estimates of cancer-attributable costs ranged from 79 percent to 82 percent of spending for colorectal, 76 percent-79 percent for lung, 65 percent-74 percent for breast, and 60 percent-75 percent for prostate cancers, depending on the reference cohort used. For all cancers, estimates were higher when patients were used as their own control, compared to demographic and comorbidity-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Choice of reference group can have a substantial impact on proportion of total costs attributed to cancer and should be clearly defined in analyses of the costs of cancer care.

The association between diabetes and cancer risk remains controversial. Hence, we examined whether midlife diabetes is related to the risk of cancer in late-life, and whether genetic and early-life environmental factors play a role in this association. This study included 25,154 twin individuals born in 1958 or earlier from the Swedish Twin Registry. Information on cancer diagnosis in late life (aged >/= 65) during 1998-2014, was derived from the National Patient and Cancer Registries. Diabetes was ascertained based on self- or informant-reported history, patient registry and antidiabetic medication use. Midlife diabetes was defined when diabetes was diagnosed before 65 years. Data were analyzed following two strategies: (i) unmatched case-control analysis for all participants using generalized estimating equation (GEE) models, and (ii) co-twin control analysis for cancer-discordant twin pairs using conditional logistic regression. Overall, 1,766 (7.0%) had midlife diabetes and 5,293 (21.0%) had cancer in late-life. In multiadjusted GEE models, the odds ratios (95% CIs) of diabetes were 10.55 (2.95-37.67) for pharynx cancer, 5.78 (1.72-19.40) for small intestine cancer, 2.37 (1.14-4.91) for liver cancer and 0.48 (0.35-0.67) for prostate cancer. In people with diabetes, diabetes duration was dose-dependently associated with cancer risk. In conditional logistic regression analysis of 176 prostate cancer-discordant twin pairs, the association between midlife diabetes and prostate cancer in later life became stronger. Midlife diabetes increases the risk of pharynx, small intestine and liver cancers, but reduces prostate cancer risk in late life. Genetic and early-life environmental factors may partially contribute to the diabetes-prostate cancer association.

BACKGROUND: Annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States are provided through an ongoing collaboration among the American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). This annual report highlights the increasing burden of liver and intrahepatic bile duct (liver) cancers. METHODS: Cancer incidence data were obtained from the CDC, NCI, and NAACCR; data about cancer deaths were obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). Annual percent changes in incidence and death rates (age-adjusted to the 2000 US Standard Population) for all cancers combined and for the leading cancers among men and women were estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term trends (incidence for 1992-2012 and mortality for 1975-2012) and short-term trends (2008-2012). In-depth analysis of liver cancer incidence included an age-period-cohort analysis and an incidence-based estimation of person-years of life lost because of the disease. By using NCHS multiple causes of death data, hepatitis C virus (HCV) and liver cancer-associated death rates were examined from 1999 through 2013. RESULTS: Among men and women of all major racial and ethnic groups, death rates continued to decline for all cancers combined and for most cancer sites; the overall cancer death rate (for both sexes combined) decreased by 1.5% per year from 2003 to 2012. Overall, incidence rates decreased among men and remained stable among women from 2003 to 2012. Among both men and women, deaths from liver cancer increased at the highest rate of all cancer sites, and liver cancer incidence rates increased sharply, second only to thyroid cancer. Men had more than twice the incidence rate of liver cancer than women, and rates increased with age for both sexes. Among non-Hispanic (NH) white, NH black, and Hispanic men and women, liver cancer incidence rates were higher for persons born after the 1938 to 1947 birth cohort. In contrast, there was a minimal birth cohort effect for NH Asian and Pacific Islanders (APIs). NH black men and Hispanic men had the lowest median age at death (60 and 62 years, respectively) and the highest average person-years of life lost per death (21 and 20 years, respectively) from liver cancer. HCV and liver cancer-associated death rates were highest among decedents who were born during 1945 through 1965. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, cancer incidence and mortality declined among men; and, although cancer incidence was stable among women, mortality declined. The burden of liver cancer is growing and is not equally distributed throughout the population. Efforts to vaccinate populations that are vulnerable to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and to identify and treat those living with HCV or HBV infection, metabolic conditions, alcoholic liver disease, or other causes of cirrhosis can be effective in reducing the incidence and mortality of liver cancer.

BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer often experience frequent and prolonged hospitalizations; however, the factors associated with greater health care utilization have not been described. We sought to investigate the relation between patients' physical and psychological symptom burden and health care utilization. METHODS: We enrolled patients with advanced cancer and unplanned hospitalizations from September 2014-May 2016. Upon admission, we assessed physical (Edmonton Symptom Assessment System [ESAS]) and psychological symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire 4 [PHQ-4]). We examined the relationship between symptom burden and healthcare utilization using linear regression for hospital length of stay (LOS) and Cox regression for time to first unplanned readmission within 90 days. We adjusted all models for age, sex, marital status, comorbidity, education, time since advanced cancer diagnosis, and cancer type. RESULTS: We enrolled 1,036 of 1,152 (89.9%) consecutive patients approached. Over one-half reported moderate/severe fatigue, poor well being, drowsiness, pain, and lack of appetite. PHQ-4 scores indicated that 28.8% and 28.0% of patients had depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. The mean hospital LOS was 6.3 days, and the 90-day readmission rate was 43.1%. Physical symptoms (ESAS: unstandardized coefficient [B], 0.06; P < .001), psychological distress (PHQ-4 total: B, 0.11; P = .040), and depression symptoms (PHQ-4 depression: B, 0.22; P = .017) were associated with longer hospital LOS. Physical (ESAS: hazard ratio, 1.01; P < .001), and anxiety symptoms (PHQ-4 anxiety: hazard ratio, 1.06; P = .045) were associated with a higher likelihood for readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalized patients with advanced cancer experience a high symptom burden, which is significantly associated with prolonged hospitalizations and readmissions. Interventions are needed to address the symptom burden of this population to improve health care delivery and utilization. Cancer 2017;123:4720-4727. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

Early cancer detection is fundamental to the promotion of better health in the community, but disparities remain in the likelihood of cancer being detected at an early stage, some of which relate to socio-demographic factors such as marital status. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review of research on the association between marital status and stage at diagnosis of different types of cancer. A comprehensive systematic literature search was run in the Medline and Scopus databases (from January 1990 to June 2014), identifying 245 and 208 articles on PubMed and Scopus respectively. Of these 453 studies, 18 were judged eligible for this systematic review. A quality assessment was performed on the studies using the 22 items in the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) checklist. This review confirmed the important influence of being married on the earlier detection of cancer. None of the studies considered identified more cases of cancer in a later stage among married patients, and the majority of them reported a statically significant association between marital status and stage at diagnosis, with a positive effect of marriage on the likelihood of cancer being diagnosed at an early stage, for various types of malignancy. In particular, our meta-analysis showed that the unmarried have higher odds of having a later stage of breast cancer (OR = 1.287 95% CI: 1.025-1.617) or melanoma (OR = 1.350 95% CI: 1.161-1.570) at diagnosis. Specific interventions should be developed for the unmarried population to improve their chances of any neoplasms being diagnosed at an early stage, thereby reducing health disparities in the population at large.

BACKGROUND: Cannabis is purported to alleviate symptoms related to cancer treatment, although the patterns of use among cancer patients are not well known. This study was designed to determine the prevalence and methods of use among cancer patients, the perceived benefits, and the sources of information in a state with legalized cannabis. METHODS: A cross-sectional, anonymous survey of adult cancer patients was performed at a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center in Washington State. Random urine samples for tetrahydrocannabinol provided survey validation. RESULTS: Nine hundred twenty-six of 2737 eligible patients (34%) completed the survey, and the median age was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR], 46-66 years). Most had a strong interest in learning about cannabis during treatment (6 on a 1-10 scale; IQR, 3-10) and wanted information from cancer providers (677 of 911 [74%]). Previous use was common (607 of 926 [66%]); 24% (222 of 926) used cannabis in the last year, and 21% (192 of 926) used cannabis in the last month. Random urine samples found similar percentages of users who reported weekly use (27 of 193 [14%] vs 164 of 926 [18%]). Active users inhaled (153 of 220 [70%]) or consumed edibles (154 of 220 [70%]); 89 (40%) used both modalities. Cannabis was used primarily for physical (165 of 219 [75%]) and neuropsychiatric symptoms (139 of 219 [63%]). Legalization significantly increased the likelihood of use in more than half of the respondents. CONCLUSIONS: This study of cancer patients in a state with legalized cannabis found high rates of active use across broad subgroups, and legalization was reported to be important in patients' decision to use. Cancer patients desire but are not receiving information about cannabis use during their treatment from oncology providers. Cancer 2017;123:4488-97. (c) 2017 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: According to the definition by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), primary multiple neoplasms are two or more neoplasms of different histopathological build in one organ, or two or more tumors occurring in one patient, regardless of the time of their occurrence (synchronic - up to 6 months, metachronous - after 6 months), coming from an organ or a tissue and not being an infiltration from another neoplasm, a relapse or a metastasis. OBJECTIVES: It was the aim of the study to analyze the frequency of the occurrence of multiple neoplasms among patients suffering from uterine cervix cancer, with a special interest in coexistent neoplasms, the time of their occurrence and total 5-year survivals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The data from the Lower Silesian Cancer Registry concerning the years 1984-2009 formed the material of the present study. RESULTS: 5.3% of all cervix neoplasms occurred as multiple cancers. Cervix neoplasms were 13.4% of multiple neoplasms. On average, cervical cancer occurred as a subsequent cancer in 6 patients yearly (60.7% of the occurrences of cervical cancer were in the period of 5 years following treatment for the first neoplasm). 5-year survival in patients suffering from primarily multiple cervix neoplasms constituted 57% and was convergent with the results for all patients suffering from cervical cancer. Cervical cancer as the first neoplasm occurred in 287 patients, on average in 11 patients annually. In the period of the first 5 years after the treatment of cervical cancer, there were 42.8% occurrences of other cancers. Cervical neoplasms most frequently coexisted with cancers of the breast, lung and large intestine. CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of the occurrence of multiple neoplasm among cervical cancer patients is increasing. Most frequently they coexist with other tobacco-related neoplasms, those related to HPV infections and with secondary post-radiation neoplasms. These facts should be taken into consideration during post-treatment observation and when directing diagnostic and prophylactic tests. Synchronic neoplasms require detailed diagnostics and planning of treatment by a team of specialists. The occurrence of primary multiple cervical neoplasms does not worsen the prognosis as compared to patients suffering exclusively from cervical cancer.

BACKGROUND: Major salivary gland cancers (M-SGCs) are rare, and have distinct heterogeneous histopathological subtypes. To the authors' knowledge, no consistent evidence of an association between cigarette smoking and the risk of M-SGCs has appeared to date. Furthermore, evidence of potential heterogeneity in the impact of smoking on histopathological subtypes is scarce, despite the fact that the histopathological subtypes of M-SGC exhibit different genetic features. METHODS: The authors conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between smoking and M-SGC by histopathological subtype. Cases were 81 patients with M-SGCs and the controls were 810 age-matched and sex-matched first-visit outpatients without cancer treated at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital from 1988 to 2005. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were assessed by conditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Smoking was found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of M-SGC overall, with an OR of 3.45 (95% CI, 1.58-7.51; P =.001) for heavy smokers compared with never-smokers. A significant dose-response relationship was observed (P for trend, .001). When stratified by histological subtype, no obvious impact of smoking was observed among patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC). In contrast, smoking demonstrated a significantly increased risk of M-SGCs other than MEC, with an OR of 5.15 (95% CI, 2.06-12.87; P<.001) for heavy smokers compared with never-smokers. The authors observed possible heterogeneity with regard to the impact of smoking on risk between MEC and M-SGCs other than MEC (P for heterogeneity, .052). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate a significant positive association between cigarette smoking and the risk of M-SGC overall. However, the impact of smoking appeared to be limited to M-SGCs other than MEC. Cancer 2018;124:118-24. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Depression screening in patients with cancer is recommended by major clinical guidelines, although the evidence on individual screening tools is limited for this population. Here, the authors assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of 2 established screening instruments: the depression modules of the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS-D), in a representative sample of patients with cancer. METHODS: This multicenter study was conducted with a proportional, stratified, random sample of 2141 patients with cancer across all major tumor sites and treatment settings. The PHQ-9 and HADS-D were assessed and compared in terms of diagnostic accuracy and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition diagnosis of major depressive disorder using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview for Oncology as the criterion standard. RESULTS: The diagnostic accuracy of the PHQ-9 and HADS-D was fair for diagnosing major depressive disorder, with areas under the ROC curves of 0.78 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-0.79) and 0.75 (95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.77), respectively. The 2 questionnaires did not differ significantly in their areas under the ROC curves (P = .15). The PHQ-9 with a cutoff score >/=7 had the best screening performance, with a sensitivity of 83% (95% confidence interval, 78%-89%) and a specificity of 61% (95% confidence interval, 59%-63%). The American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline screening algorithm had a sensitivity of 44% (95% confidence interval, 36%-51%) and a specificity of 84% (95% confidence interval, 83%-85%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cancer, the screening performance of both the PHQ-9 and the HADS-D was limited compared with a standardized diagnostic interview. Costs and benefits of routinely screening all patients with cancer should be weighed carefully. Cancer 2017;123:4236-4243. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The tumor protein p53 (TP53) arginine-to-histidine mutation at codon 337 (R337H) predisposes children to adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) and, rarely, to other childhood tumors, but its impact on adult cancer remains undetermined. The objective of this study was to investigate the frequency and types of cancer in relatives of children with ACT who carry the TP53 R337H mutation. METHODS: TP53 R337H testing was offered to relatives of probands with ACT. The parental lineage segregating the R337H mutation was identified in all families. The frequency and distribution of cancer types were compared according to R337H status. The authors' data also were compared with those publicly available for children with TP53 mutations other than R337H. RESULTS: The mean and median follow-up times for the probands with ACT were 11.2 years and 9.7 years (range, 3-32 years), respectively. During this time, cancer was diagnosed in 12 of 81 first-degree relatives (14.8%) carrying the R337H mutation but in only 1 of 94 noncarriers (1.1%; P = .0022). At age 45 years, the cumulative risk of cancer was 21% (95% confidence interval, 5%-33%) in carriers and 2% (95% confidence interval, 0%-4%) in noncarriers (P = .008). The frequency of cancer was higher in the R337H segregating lineages than in the nonsegregating lineages (249 of 1410 vs 66 of 984 individuals; P < .001). Breast and gastric cancer were the most common types. CONCLUSIONS: TP53 R337H carriers have a lifelong predisposition to cancer with a bimodal age distribution: 1 peak, represented by ACT, occurs in the first decade of life, and another peak of diverse cancer types occurs in the fifth decade. The current findings have implications for genetic counseling and surveillance of R337H carriers. Cancer 2017;123:3150-58. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: In the United States, the burden of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers varies by racial/ethnic group. HPV vaccination may provide opportunities for primary prevention of these cancers. Herein, the authors projected changes in HPV-associated cancer burden among racial/ethnic groups under various coverage assumptions with the available first-generation and second-generation HPV vaccines to evaluate changes in racial/ethnic disparities. METHODS: Cancer-specific mathematical models simulated the burden of 6 HPV-associated cancers. Model parameters, informed using national registries and epidemiological studies, reflected sex-specific, age-specific, and racial/ethnic-specific heterogeneities in HPV type distribution, cancer incidence, stage of disease at detection, and mortality. Model outcomes included the cumulative lifetime risks of developing and dying of 6 HPV-associated cancers. The level of racial/ethnic disparities was evaluated under each alternative HPV vaccine scenario using several metrics of social group disparity. RESULTS: HPV vaccination is expected to reduce the risks of developing and dying of HPV-associated cancers in all racial/ethnic groups as well as reduce the absolute degree of disparities. However, alternative metrics suggested that relative disparities would persist and in some scenarios worsen. For example, when assuming high uptake with the second-generation HPV vaccine, the lifetime risk of dying of an HPV-associated cancer for males decreased by approximately 60%, yet the relative disparity increased from 3.0 to 3.9. CONCLUSIONS: HPV vaccines are expected to reduce the overall burden of HPV-associated cancers for all racial/ethnic groups and to reduce the absolute disparity gap. However, even with the second-generation vaccine, relative disparities will likely still exist and may widen if the underlying causes of these disparities remain unaddressed. Cancer 2016;122:2057-66.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Few studies have evaluated the risk of postoperative colorectal neoplasms stratified by the nature of primary colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we revealed it on the basis of the microsatellite (MS) status of primary CRC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 338 patients with CRC and calculated the risk of neoplasms during postoperative surveillance colonoscopy in association with the MS status of primary CRC. A propensity score method was applied. RESULTS: We identified a higher incidence of metachronous rectal neoplasms after the resection of MS stable CRC than MS instable CRC (adjusted HR 5.74, p=0.04). We also observed a higher incidence of colorectal tubular adenoma in patients with MSS CRC (adjusted hazard ratio 7.09, p<0.01) and a higher incidence of postoperative tubulovillous/villous adenoma in patients with MS instable CRC (adjusted HR=8.50, p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The MS status of primary colorectal cancer influenced the risk of postoperative colorectal neoplasms.

BACKGROUND: The landscape of hereditary syndromes and clinicopathologic characteristics among US Latino/Hispanic individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC) remains poorly understood. METHODS: A total of 265 patients with CRC who were enrolled in the Hispanic Colorectal Cancer Study were included in the current study. Information regarding CRC risk factors was elicited through interviews, and treatment and survival data were abstracted from clinical charts. Tumor studies and germline genetic testing results were collected from medical records or performed using standard molecular methods. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 53.7 years (standard deviation, 10.3 years), and 48.3% were female. Overall, 21.2% of patients reported a first-degree or second-degree relative with CRC; 3.4% met Amsterdam I/II criteria. With respect to Bethesda guidelines, 38.5% of patients met at least 1 criterion. Of the 161 individuals who had immunohistochemistry and/or microsatellite instability testing performed, 21 (13.0%) had mismatch repair (MMR)-deficient (dMMR) tumors. dMMR tumors were associated with female sex (61.9%), earlier age at the time of diagnosis (50.4 +/- 12.4 years), proximal location (61.9%), and first-degree (23.8%) or second-degree (9.5%) family history of CRC. Among individuals with dMMR tumors, 13 (61.9%) had a germline MMR mutation (MutL homolog 1 [MLH1] in 6 patients; MutS homolog 2 [MSH2] in 4 patients; MutS homolog 6 [MHS6] in 2 patients; and PMS1 homolog 2, mismatch repair system component [PMS2] in 1 patient). The authors identified 2 additional MLH1 mutation carriers by genetic testing who had not received immunohistochemistry/microsatellite instability testing. In total, 5.7% of the entire cohort were confirmed to have Lynch syndrome. In addition, 6 individuals (2.3%) had a polyposis phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The percentage of dMMR tumors noted among Latino individuals (13%) is similar to estimates in non-Hispanic white individuals. In the current study, the majority of individuals with dMMR tumors were confirmed to have Lynch syndrome. Cancer 2017. (c) 2017 The Authors.

The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) is significantly increasing in the United States. Given that these epidemiologic trends are driven by human papillomavirus (HPV), the potential impact of prophylactic HPV vaccines on the prevention of OPC is of interest. The primary evidence supporting the approval of current prophylactic HPV vaccines is from large phase 3 clinical trials focused on the prevention of genital disease (cervical and anal cancer, as well as genital warts). These trials reported vaccine efficacy rates of 89% to 98% for the prevention of both premalignant lesions and persistent genital infections. However, these trials were designed before the etiologic relationship between HPV and OPC was established. There are differences in the epidemiology of oral and genital HPV infection, such as differences in age and sex distributions, which suggest that the vaccine efficacy observed in genital cancers may not be directly translatable to the cancers of the oropharynx. Evaluation of vaccine efficacy is challenging in the oropharynx because no premalignant lesion analogous to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia in cervical cancer has yet been identified. To truly investigate the efficacy of these vaccines in the oropharynx, additional clinical trials with feasible endpoints are needed. Cancer 2016;122:2313-2323. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The effect of health insurance on childhood cancer survival has not been well studied. Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, this study was designed to assess the association between health insurance status and childhood cancer survival. METHODS: Data on cancers diagnosed among children less than 15 years old from 2007 to 2009 were obtained from the SEER 18 registries. The effect of health insurance at diagnosis on 5-year childhood cancer mortality was estimated with marginal survival probabilities, restricted mean survival times, and Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression analyses, which were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, and county-level poverty. RESULTS: Among 8219 childhood cancer cases, the mean survival time was 1.32 months shorter (95% confidence interval [CI], -4.31 to 1.66) after 5 years for uninsured children (n = 131) versus those with private insurance (n = 4297), whereas the mean survival time was 0.62 months shorter (95% CI, -1.46 to 0.22) for children with Medicaid at diagnosis (n = 2838). In Cox PH models, children who were uninsured had a 1.26-fold higher risk of cancer death (95% CI, 0.84-1.90) than those who were privately insured at diagnosis. The risk for those with Medicaid was similar to the risk for those with private insurance at diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.93-1.21). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the results suggest that cancer survival is largely similar for children with Medicaid and those with private insurance at diagnosis. Slightly inferior survival was observed for those who were uninsured in comparison with those with private insurance at diagnosis. The latter result is based on a small number of uninsured children and should be interpreted cautiously. Further study is needed to confirm and clarify the reasons for these patterns.

BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to characterize trends and survival outcomes for chemotherapy in the definitive and adjuvant treatment of hypopharyngeal cancer in the United States. METHODS: A total of 16,248 adult patients diagnosed with primary hypopharyngeal cancer without distant metastases between 1998 and 2011 were identified in the National Cancer Data Base. The association between treatment modality and overall survival was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier survival curves and 5-year survival rates. A multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed on a subset of 3357 cases to determine the treatment modalities that predict improved survival when controlling for demographic and clinical factors. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the use of chemotherapy with radiotherapy both as definitive treatment (P<.001) and as adjuvant chemoradiotherapy with surgery (P=.001). This was accompanied by a decrease in total laryngectomy/pharyngectomy rates (P<.001). Chemoradiotherapy was associated with improved 5-year survival compared with radiotherapy alone in the definitive setting (31.8% vs 25.2%; log rank P<.001). Similarly, in multivariateanalysis, definitive radiotherapy was found to be associated with compromised survival compared with definitive chemoradiotherapy (hazard ratio, 1.51; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Survival analysis revealed that overall 5-year survival rates were higher for chemoradiotherapy compared with radiotherapy alone in the definitive setting, but were comparable between surgery with chemoradiotherapy and surgery with radiotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Although hospitalized patients with advanced cancer have a low chance of surviving cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the processes by which they change their code status from full code to do not resuscitate (DNR) are unknown. METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study on a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with advanced cancer. Two physicians used a consensus-driven medical record review to characterize processes that led to code status order transitions from full code to DNR. RESULTS: In total, 1047 hospitalizations were reviewed among 728 patients. Admitting clinicians did not address code status in 53% of hospitalizations, resulting in code status orders of "presumed full." In total, 275 patients (26.3%) transitioned from full code to DNR, and 48.7% (134 of 275 patients) of those had an order of "presumed full" at admission; however, upon further clarification, the patients expressed that they had wished to be DNR before the hospitalization. We identified 3 additional processes leading to order transition from full code to DNR acute clinical deterioration (15.3%), discontinuation of cancer-directed therapy (17.1%), and education about the potential harms/futility of CPR (15.3%). Compared with discontinuing therapy and education, transitions because of acute clinical deterioration were associated with less patient involvement (P = .002), a shorter time to death (P < .001), and a greater likelihood of inpatient death (P = .005). CONCLUSIONS: One-half of code status order changes among hospitalized patients with advanced cancer were because of full code orders in patients who had a preference for DNR before hospitalization. Transitions due of acute clinical deterioration were associated with less patient engagement and a higher likelihood of inpatient death. Cancer 2017;123:4895-902. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to examine temporal trends and compare overall survival (OS) in patients undergoing radical cystectomy (RC) or bladder-preservation therapy (BPT) for muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. METHODS: The authors reviewed the National Cancer Data Base to identify patients with AJCC stage II to III urothelial carcinoma of the bladder from 2004 through 2013. Patients receiving BPT were stratified as having received any external-beam radiotherapy (any XRT), definitive XRT (50-80 grays), and definitive XRT with chemotherapy (CRT). Treatment trends and OS outcomes for the BPT and RC cohorts were evaluated using Cochran-Armitage tests, unadjusted Kaplan-Meier curves, adjusted Cox multivariate regression, and propensity score matching, using increasingly stringent selection criteria. RESULTS: A total of 32,300 patients met the inclusion criteria and were treated with RC (22,680 patients) or BPT (9620 patients). Of the patients treated with BPT, 26.4% (2540 patients) and 15.5% (1489 patients), respectively, were treated with definitive XRT and CRT. Improved OS was observed for RC in all groups. After adjustments with more rigorous statistical models controlling for confounders and with more restrictive BPT cohorts, the magnitude of the OS benefit became attenuated on multivariate (any XRT: hazard ratio [HR], 2.115 [95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.045-2.188]; definitive XRT: HR, 1.870 [95% CI, 1.773-1.972]; and CRT: HR, 1.578 [95% CI, 1.474-1.691]) and propensity score (any XRT: HR, 2.008 [95% CI, 1.871-2.154]; definitive XRT: HR, 1.606 [95% CI, 1.453-1.776]; and CRT: HR, 1.406 [95% CI, 1.235-1.601]) analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In the National Cancer Data Base, receipt of BPT was associated with decreased OS compared with RC in patients with stage II to III urothelial carcinoma. Increasingly stringent definitions of BPT and more rigorous statistical methods adjusting for selection biases attenuated observed survival differences. Cancer 2017;123:4337-45.

AIM: We aimed to assess the overall cancer risk among contemporary menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) users in Sweden and the risk for different cancer types. METHODS: A nationwide Swedish population-based cohort study including all 290,186 women aged >/= 40 years having used systemic MHT during the study period (July 2005 and December 2012), compared with the Swedish female background population. MHT ever-use (all MHT, oestrogen-only MHT [E-MHT] and oestrogen plus progestin MHT [EP-MHT]) was based on the nationwide Prescribed Drug Registry. Cancer diagnoses were grouped into 16 different anatomical locations, for which standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS: The SIR of any cancer was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.07-1.11) following ever MHT, 1.04 (95% CI: 1.01-1.06) for E-MHT and 1.14 (95% CI: 1.12-1.17) for EP-MHT. The highest SIR was found for EP-MHT among users aged >/=70 years (SIR = 1.33, 95% CI: 1.26-1.40). The risk for invasive breast, endometrial or ovarian cancer combined was increased for any MHT (SIR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.28-1.34). The risk of invasive breast cancer was increased following MHT and increased with age for EP-MHT users. The risk of gastrointestinal cancers combined was decreased (SIR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.86-0.94), particularly the oesophagus (SIR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.64-1.00), liver (SIR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.65-0.99) and colon (SIR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84-0.95). CONCLUSIONS: MHT, notably EP-MHT, was associated with a limited increase in overall cancer risk. The increased risk of female reproductive organ cancers was almost balanced by a decreased risk of gastrointestinal cancers.

BACKGROUND: Solid organ transplantation recipients have elevated cancer incidence. Estimates of absolute cancer risk after transplantation can inform prevention and screening. METHODS: The Transplant Cancer Match Study links the US transplantation registry with 14 state/regional cancer registries. The authors used nonparametric competing risk methods to estimate the cumulative incidence of cancer after transplantation for 2 periods (1987-1999 and 2000-2008). For recipients from 2000 to 2008, the 5-year cumulative incidence, stratified by organ, sex, and age at transplantation, was estimated for 6 preventable or screen-detectable cancers. For comparison, the 5-year cumulative incidence was calculated for the same cancers in the general population at representative ages using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. RESULTS: Among 164,156 recipients, 8520 incident cancers were identified. The absolute cancer risk was slightly higher for recipients during the period from 2000 to 2008 than during the period from 1987 to 1999 (5-year cumulative incidence: 4.4% vs. 4.2%; P = .006); this difference arose from the decreasing risk of competing events (5-year cumulative incidence of death, graft failure, or retransplantation: 26.6% vs. 31.9%; P < .001). From 2000 to 2008, the 5-year cumulative incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma was highest at extremes of age, especially in thoracic organ recipients (ages 0-34 years: range, 1.74%-3.28%; aged >50 years; range, 0.36%-2.22%). For recipients aged >50 years, the 5-year cumulative incidence was higher for colorectal cancer (range, 0.33%-1.94%) than for the general population at the recommended screening age (aged 50 years: range, 0.25%-0.33%). For recipients aged >50 years, the 5-year cumulative incidence was high for lung cancer among thoracic organ recipients (range, 1.16%-3.87%) and for kidney cancer among kidney recipients (range, 0.53%-0.84%). The 5-year cumulative incidence for prostate cancer and breast cancer was similar or lower in transplantation recipients than at the recommended ages of screening in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Subgroups of transplantation recipients have a high absolute risk of some cancers and may benefit from targeted prevention or screening.

Objectives: To describe the incidence and mortality for the five main types of cancer in Colombia, from 2007-2011. Methods: We estimated cases and cancer incidence rates standardised by age, based on incidence/mortality ratios; and we calculated the observed deaths and mortality rates standardised by age in Colombia, both differentiated by province, type of cancer and sex. Incidence estimates were generated based on information from four cancer population registries (Cali, Pasto, Bucaramanga and Manizales), published in Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, volume X, and the official mortality and population information of the National Administrative Province of Statistics (DANE, for its initials in Spanish). Results: The annual number of expected cases (all cancers) was 62,818 in men and women; and there were 32,653 recorded deaths. The main incidental cancers were prostate (46.5 per 100,000 person-years) in men, and breast (33.8 per 100,000 person-years) in women. The highest mortality figures were for stomach cancer in men (14.2); and breast cancer in women (9.9). Conclusions: The highest incidence and mortality estimates in Colombia were for breast and prostate cancers, as well as a proportion of infection-related cancers, such as stomach and cervical cancer. These four neoplasms were responsible for more than 50% of the burden of the disease. Only through good quality, long-duration cancer registries, can information be obtained about the changes in incidence trends.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of colorectal cancer in young patients involves both management of the incident cancer and consideration of the possibility of Lynch syndrome and the development of metachronous colorectal cancers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to assess the prognostic role of DNA mismatch repair deficiency and extended colorectal resection for metachronous colorectal neoplasia risk in young patients with colorectal cancer. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: This is a retrospective review of 285 patients identified in our GI cancer registry with colorectal cancer diagnosed at 35 years or younger in the absence of polyposis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Using univariate and multivariate analysis, we assessed the prognostic role of mismatch repair deficiency and standard clinicopathologic characteristics, including the extent of resection, on the rate of developing metachronous colorectal neoplasia requiring resection. RESULTS: Mismatch repair deficiency was identified in biospecimens from 44% of patients and was significantly associated with an increased risk for metachronous colorectal neoplasia requiring resection (10-year cumulative risk, 13.5% +/- 4.2%) compared with 56% of patients with mismatch repair-intact colorectal cancer (10-year cumulative risk, 5.8% +/- 3.3%; p = 0.011). In multivariate analysis, mismatch repair deficiency was associated with a HR of 3.65 (95% CI, 1.44-9.21; p = 0.006) for metachronous colorectal neoplasia, whereas extended resection with ileorectal or ileosigmoid anastomosis significantly decreased the risk of metachronous colorectal neoplasia (HR, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.05-0.90; p = 0.036). LIMITATIONS: This study had a retrospective design, and, therefore, recommendations for colorectal cancer surgery and screening were not fully standardized. Quality of life after colorectal cancer surgery was not assessed. CONCLUSIONS: Young patients with colorectal cancer with molecular hallmarks of Lynch syndrome were at significantly higher risk for the development of subsequent colorectal neoplasia. This risk was significantly reduced in those who underwent extended resection compared with segmental resection.

BACKGROUND: Black men in the United States have substantially higher prostate cancer incidence rates than the general population. The extent to which this incidence disparity is because prostate cancer is more prevalent, more aggressive, and/or more frequently diagnosed in black men is unknown. METHODS: The authors estimated 3 independently developed models of prostate cancer natural history in black men and in the general population using an updated reconstruction of prostate-specific antigen screening, based on the National Health Interview Survey in 2005 and on prostate cancer incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program during 1975 through 2000. By using the estimated models, the natural history of prostate cancer was compared between black men and the general population. RESULTS: The models projected that from 30% to 43% (range across models) of black men develop preclinical prostate cancer by age 85 years, a risk that is (relatively) 28% to 56% higher than that in the general population. Among men who had preclinical disease onset, black men had a similar risk of diagnosis (range, 35%-49%) compared with the general population (32%-44%), but their risk of progression to metastatic disease by the time of diagnosis was from 44% to 75% higher than that in the general population. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer incidence patterns implicate higher incidence of preclinical disease and higher risk of metastatic progression among black men. The findings suggest screening black men earlier than white men and support further research into the benefit-harm tradeoffs of more aggressive screening policies for black men.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian metastases from colorectal cancer (OM-CRC) often are unresponsive to chemotherapy and are associated with poor survival. To the authors' knowledge, the clinicopathologic and genomic predictors of OM-CRC are poorly characterized and optimal clinical management remains unclear. METHODS: Women with a histopathological diagnosis of OM-CRC who were treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center from 1999 to 2015 were identified. Next-generation somatic mutation profiling (Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets [MSK-IMPACT]) was performed on 38 OM-CRC cases, including 21 matched tumor pairs/trios. Regression models were used to analyze variables associated with progression-free survival and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Kirsten Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homolog (KRAS), SMAD family member 4 (SMAD4), and neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase 1 (NTRK1) mutations were more frequent in cases of OM-CRC than in instances of CRC occurring without OM. SMAD4 and lysine methyltransferase 2D (KMT2D) mutations were associated with reduced OS. Matched multisite tumor sequencing did not identify OM-specific genomic alterations. Of the 195 patients who underwent oophorectomy for OM-CRC (median age, 49 years with a progression-free survival of 9.4 months and an OS of 23 months from oophorectomy), 76% had extraovarian metastasis (EOM). In multivariable analysis, residual disease after surgery (R2 resection) was associated with worse survival. Patients with EOM were less likely to achieve R0/R1 surgical resection status (complete macroscopic resection without clinical/radiological evidence of disease) (48% vs 94%). However, if R0/R1 resection status was achieved, both patients with (35.9 months vs 12 months) and without (43.2 months vs 14.5 months) EOM were found to have better OS. Among 114 patients with R0/R1 resection status, 23 (20%) had no disease recurrence, including 10 patients (9%) with > 3 years of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Loss-of-function alterations in SMAD4 are frequent and predictive of worse survival in patients with OM-CRC. Similar to oligometastatic CRC to the lung or liver, surgical resection of OM-CRC is associated with a better outcome only if all macroscopic metastatic disease is resected.

BACKGROUND: Cancer registries use algorithms to process cause of death (COD) data from death certificates, but uncertainties remain regarding the accuracy and utility of those data in calculating cancer-specific survival (CSS). Because it is impractical to reconfirm the COD through meticulous review of the primary medical records, the observed cancer deaths could be compared with the number of attributed deaths, as estimated by using a relative survival (RS) approach, to determine utility in CSS estimation. METHODS: Six major cancer types were evaluated using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data (1988-1999 cohort). The COD utility was quantified by using the observed-to-expected ratio (O/E ratio) approach, which was calculated as the SEER-documented observed number of cancer-specific deaths divided by the number of expected deaths attributed to the malignancies as estimated using a RS approach. Favorable utility would have an O/E ratio close to 1. RESULTS: In total, 338,445 patients were identified; and their O/E ratios were 0.97, 0.98, 0.90, 1.07, 1.02, and 0.92 for breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, prostate, and pancreas cancer, respectively. O/E ratios varied slightly with patients' age, race, and tumor stage, but not by sex. CSS for patients with lung cancer appeared to be overestimated considerably. Patients with multiple cancer diagnoses had poor O/E ratios compared with those who had only 1 cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The utility of COD in calculating CSS depended variously on the risk of cancer-related mortality and nontumor factors. However, the impact of this variation on CSS generally was small. The current results indicated that the COD assigned by cancer registries has acceptable validity, and CSS is considered an acceptable surrogate for RS in most circumstances.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is not clear how best to manage patients with low-risk intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) of the pancreas because little is known about IPMN progression to cancer. We sought to determine the cumulative incidence of development of pancreatic cancer in persons with unresected IPMNs (particularly low-risk IPMNs). METHODS: We performed a systematic search of the MEDLINE and Embase databases through November 30, 2016 for studies reporting the cumulative incidence of pancreatic cancer in patients with unresected IPMNs or studies that provided data in sufficient detail for us to calculate cumulative incidence values. We categorized patient series as studies on low-risk IPMNs (lesions without main pancreatic duct involvement or mural nodules) or non-low-risk IPMNs. We calculated meta-analytic cumulative incidence values for pancreatic cancer at 1, 3, 5, and 10 years of follow-up by using the inverse variance method and random-effects model. RESULTS: Among 1514 articles screened, we identified 10 studies of low-risk IPMNs (n = 2411) and 9 studies of non-low-risk IPMNs (n = 825). In studies of low-risk IPMNs, the meta-analytic cumulative incidence values for pancreatic cancer were 0.02% at 1 year (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.0%-0.23%; I(2)= 0.0%), 1.40% at 3 years (95% CI, 0.58%-2.48%; I(2) = 58.5%), 3.12% at 5 years (95% CI, 1.12%-5.90%; I(2) = 88.0%), and 7.77% at 10 years (95% CI, 4.09%-12.39%; I(2) = 79.8%). These values were much higher in studies of non-low-risk IPMNs; cumulative incidence values for pancreatic cancer were 1.95% at 1 year (95% CI, 0.0%-5.99%; I(2) = 84.2%), 5.69% at 3 years (95% CI, 1.10%-12.77%; I(2) = 89.9%), 9.77% at 5 years (95% CI, 3.04%-19.27%; I(2) = 92.0%), and 24.68% at 10 years (95% CI, 14.87%-35.90%; I(2) = 74.3%). The pooled cumulative incidence steadily increased linearly as the follow-up duration increased. CONCLUSIONS: In a systematic review and meta-analysis, we found that low-risk IPMNs have almost 8% chance of progressing to pancreatic cancer within 10 years, and higher-risk IPMNs have almost 25% chance of progressing to cancer in 10 years; incidence values increase linearly with time. Continued long-term surveillance is therefore vital for patients with low-risk IPMNs.

Informal/family caregivers are a fundamental source of care for cancer patients in the United States, yet the population of caregivers and their tasks, psychosocial needs, and health outcomes are not well understood. Changes in the nature of cancer care and its delivery, along with the growing population of survivors and their caregivers, warrant increased attention to the roles and demands of caregiving. This article reviews current evidence presented at a 2-day meeting examining the state of the science of informal cancer caregiving that was convened by the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Nursing Research. The meeting sought to define who is an informal cancer caregiver, summarize the state of the science in informal cancer caregiving, and describe both the kinds of interventions developed to address caregiving challenges and the various outcomes used to evaluate their impact. This article offers recommendations for moving science forward in 4 areas: 1) improving the estimation of the prevalence and burden of informal cancer caregiving; 2) advancing the development of interventions designed to improve outcomes for cancer patients, caregivers, and patient-caregiver dyads; 3) generating and testing strategies for integrating caregivers into formal health care settings; and 4) promoting the use of technology to support informal cancer caregivers.

BACKGROUND: Ewing sarcoma survivors (ESSs) are at increased risk for treatment-related complications. The incidence of treatment-related morbidity and late mortality with aging is unknown. METHODS: This study reports survival probabilities, estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method, and the cumulative incidence of cause-specific mortality and chronic conditions among ESSs in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who were treated between 1970 and 1986. Piecewise exponential models were used to estimate relative rates (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for these outcomes. Chronic conditions were graded with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). RESULTS: Among 404 5-year ESSs (median age at last follow-up, 34.8 years; range, 9.1-54.8 years), the 35-year survival rate was 70% (95% CI, 66%-74%). Late recurrence (cumulative incidence at 35 years, 15.1%) was the most common cause of death, and it was followed by treatment-related causes (11.2%). There were 53 patients with subsequent neoplasms (SNs; cumulative incidence at 35 years, 24.0%), and 38 were malignant (14.3% at 35 years). The standardized incidence ratios were 377.1 (95% CI, 172.1-715.9) for osteosarcoma, 28.9 (95% CI, 3.2-104.2) for acute myeloid leukemia, 14.9 (95% CI, 7.9-25.5) for breast cancer, and 13.1 (95% CI, 4.8-28.5) for thyroid cancer. Rates of chronic conditions were highest for musculoskeletal (RR, 18.1; 95% CI, 12.8-25.7) and cardiac complications (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.4-2.3). Thirty-five years after the diagnosis, the cumulative incidences of any chronic conditions and 2 or more chronic conditions were 84.6% (95% CI, 80.4%-88.8%) and 73.8% (95% CI, 67.8%-79.9%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: With extended follow-up, ESSs' risk for late mortality and SNs does not plateau. Treatment-related chronic conditions develop years after therapy, and this supports the need for lifelong follow-up. Cancer 2017;123:2551-60. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to examine the prevalence and correlates of mental distress among survivors of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer and a comparison group. METHODS: A total of 875 AYA cancer survivors who were diagnosed between the ages of 15 and 39 years and who were at least 5 years from their initial diagnosis were identified from the 2013 and 2014 National Health Interview Surveys. A comparison group was created. The Kessler nonspecific mental/psychological distress scale was used to examine none/low, moderate, and severe distress. The issues of whether individuals talked to mental health professionals within the previous year and if they could afford mental health care also were examined. Variables (ie, demographics, behavioral [eg, smoking status], comorbidity, and mental health visits) associated with distress among the 2 groups were identified using multinomial logistic regressions. RESULTS: Survivors reported mental distress more often than the comparison group (moderate: 23.2% vs 16.9%; and severe: 8.4% vs 3.0% [P<.001]). Survivors cited not being able to afford mental health care more often (6.4% vs 2.3%; P = .002). Moreover, 74.7% and 52.2% of survivors, respectively, with moderate and severe distress had not talked to a mental health professional. Contrary to the comparison group, survivors who were current smokers reported severe distress more often compared with nonsmokers (relative risk, 3.59; 95% confidence interval, 1.46-8.84 [P = .01]). Having public and no insurance versus private insurance and report of sleep-related trouble within the previous week were found to be associated with greater distress among survivors. CONCLUSIONS: AYA cancer survivors are more likely to demonstrate mental distress than individuals without cancer. Nevertheless, few survivors may be receiving professional mental health services. Survivors need greater access to mental health screening and counseling to address the current gaps in care delivery. Cancer 2017;123:869-78. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy diagnosed in women worldwide. Nearly all cases of cervical cancer result from infection with the human papillomavirus, and the prevention of cervical cancer includes screening and vaccination. Primary treatment options for patients with cervical cancer may include surgery or a concurrent chemoradiotherapy regimen consisting of cisplatin-based chemotherapy with external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy. Cervical cancer causes more than one quarter of a million deaths per year as a result of grossly deficient treatments in many developing countries. This warrants a concerted global effort to counter the shocking loss of life and suffering that largely goes unreported. This article provides a review of the biology, prevention, and treatment of cervical cancer, and discusses the global cervical cancer crisis and efforts to improve the prevention and treatment of the disease in underdeveloped countries.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a tumor phenotype linked to somatic or germline (Lynch syndrome) inactivating alterations of DNA mismatch repair genes. A broad spectrum of neoplasms exhibits MSI phenotype, mainly colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, and gastric cancer. MSI tumors are characterized by dense immune infiltration and high load of tumor neo-antigens. Growing evidence is accumulating on the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition for patients treated for MSI solid tumors. We present a comprehensive overview of MSI phenotype, its biological landscape and current diagnostic methods. Then we focus on MSI as a predictive biomarker of response to immune checkpoint inhibition in the context of colorectal cancer and non-colorectal tumors.

Objective: The registration data of local cancer registries in 2014 were collected by National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR)in 2017 to estimate the cancer incidence and mortality in China. Methods: The data submitted from 449 registries were checked and evaluated, and the data of 339 registries out of them were qualified and selected for the final analysis. Cancer incidence and mortality were stratified by area, gender, age group and cancer type, and combined with the population data of 2014 to estimate cancer incidence and mortality in China. The age composition of standard population of Chinese census in 2000 and Segi's population were used for age-standardized incidence and mortality in China and worldwide, respectively. Results: Total covered population of 339 cancer registries (129 in urban and 210 in rural) in 2014 were 288 243 347 (144 061 915 in urban and 144 181 432 in rural areas). The mortality verified cases (MV%) were 68.01%. Among them, 2.19% cases were identified through death certifications only (DCO%), and the mortality to incidence ratio was 0.61. There were about 3, 804, 000 new cases diagnosed as malignant cancer and 2, 296, 000 cases dead in 2014 in the whole country. The incidence rate was 278.07/100, 000 (males 301.67/100, 000, females 253.29/100, 000) in China, age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and by world standard population were 190.63/100, 000 and 186.53/100, 000, respectively, and the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 age years old) was 21.58%. The cancer incidence and ASIRC in urban areas were 302.13/100, 000 and 196.58/100, 000, respectively, whereas in rural areas, those were 248.94/100, 000 and 182.64/100, 000, respectively. The cancer mortality in China was 167.89/100, 000 (207.24/100, 000 in males and 126.54/100, 000 in females), age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population were 106.98/100, 000 and 106.09/100, 000, respectively. And the cumulative incidence rate (0-74 age years old) was 12.00%. The cancer mortality and ASMRC in urban areas were 174.34/100, 000 and 103.49/100, 000, respectively, whereas in rural areas, those were 160.07/100, 000 and 111.57/100, 000, respectively. Lung cancer, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer, female breast cancer, esophageal cancer, thyroid cancer, cervical cancer, encephala and pancreas cancer, were the most common cancers in China, accounting for about 77.00% of the new cancer cases. Lung cancer, liver cancer, gastric cancer, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, encephala, leukemia and lymphoma were the leading causes of death and accounted for about 83.36% of cancer deaths. Conclusions: The progression of cancer registry in China develops rapidly in these years, with the coverage of registrations is expanded and the data quality was improved steadily year by year. As the basis of cancer prevention and control program, cancer registry plays an important role in making the medium and long term of anti-cancer strategies in China. As China is still facing the serious cancer burden and the cancer patterns varies differently according to the locations and genders, effective measures and strategies of cancer prevention and control should be implemented based on the practical situation.

BackgroundSegmental neurofibromatosis, referred to as mosaic neurofibromatosis 1, patients present with neurofibromas or cafe au lait macules or both in a unilateral segment of the body.PurposeA woman with segmental neurofibromatosis and triple cancer (renal cell carcinoma, mixed thyroid carcinoma, and lentigo maligna) is described and cancers observed in patients with segmental neurofibromatosis are reviewed.MethodsPubMed was used to search the following terms, separately and in combination: cancer, malignancy, mosaic, neoplasm, neurofibroma, neurofibromatosis, segment, segmental, tumor.ResultsMalignancy (13 cancers) has been observed in 11 segmental neurofibromatosis patients; one patient had three different cancers. The most common neoplasms were of neural crest origin {malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (3 patients) and melanoma (3 patients)] and gastrointestinal tract origin [colon (1 patient) and gastric (1 patient)]. Breast cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, kidney cancer, and thyroid cancer each occurred in one patient.ConclusionsSimilar to patients with von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis 1, individuals with segmental neurofibromatosis also have a genodermatosis-associated increased risk of developing cancer.

BACKGROUND: To explore the role of bevacizumab and a chemotherapy-free approach, the authors evaluated the combination of bevacizumab, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel (HAT) and the regimen of trastuzumab and bevacizumab (HA) with the addition of paclitaxel after progression (HA-HAT) as first-line treatment for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: In a noncomparative phase 2 trial, patients were randomized between HAT and HA-HAT. The primary endpoint was the progression-free rate at 1 year (1-year PFR). In the HA-HAT group, progression-free survival (PFS) was separately established for HA (PFS1) and HAT (PFS2). RESULTS: Eighty-four patients received HAT (n = 39) or HA-HAT (n = 45). The 1-year PFR was 74.4% (95% confidence interval [CI], 61.8%-89.4%) and 62.2% (95% CI, 49.6%-89.4%) in the HAT and HA-HAT arms, respectively. The median PFS was 19.8 months (95% CI, 14.9-25.6 months) in the HAT arm and 19.6 months (95% CI, 12.0-32.0 months) in the HA-HAT arm. In the HA-HAT arm, the median PFS1 was 10.4 months (95% CI, 6.2-15.0 months), and the median PFS2 was 8.2 months (95% CI, 7.0-12.6 months). The number and severity of adverse events were comparable between the arms. CONCLUSIONS: Both HAT and HA-HAT have promising activity in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In particular, starting with only targeted agents and delaying chemotherapy is worth further exploration. Cancer 2016;122:2961-2970. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Cancer caregiving has been associated with worsening health among caregivers themselves, yet demographic and psychosocial predictors of their long-term health decline are less known. This study examines changes in caregivers' physical health 2 to 8 years after their family members' cancer diagnosis and prospective predictors of that change. METHODS: Caregivers (n = 664; mean age, 53.2 years) participated in a nationwide study at 2 (T1), 5 (T2), and 8 (T3) years after their family members' cancer diagnosis. Physical health (12-item Medical Outcomes Study Short Form Health Survey Physical Component Scale) was assessed T1 through T3 as outcome. Predictors were self-reported at T1, including caregiver demographics (age, sex, education, income, relationship to patient, and employment status), patient cancer severity (from medical records), and caregiver psychosocial factors (caregiving stress, caregiving esteem, social support, and depressive symptoms). Latent growth modeling tested predictors of caregivers' initial physical health and their physical health change across time. RESULTS: At T1, caregivers reported slightly better physical health than the US population (M = 51.22, P = .002), which declined over the following 6 years (Mslope = -0.27, P < .001). All demographic factors, patient cancer severity, and T1 caregiving stress were related to caregivers' initial physical health (P </= .03). Higher depressive symptoms were unrelated to caregivers' initial physical health, but were the only significant predictor of caregivers' more rapid physical health decline (B = -0.02, P = .004). CONCLUSION: Findings highlight the unique contribution of caregivers' depressive symptoms to their physical health decline. Assessing and addressing depressive symptoms among caregivers early in the cancer survivorship trajectory may help to prevent premature health decline among this important yet vulnerable population.

BACKGROUND: Fertility preservation care for children, adolescents, and young adults (CAYAs) with cancer is not uniform among practitioners. To ensure high-quality care, evidence-based clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) are essential. The authors identified existing CPGs for fertility preservation in CAYAs with cancer, evaluated their quality, and explored differences in recommendations. METHODS: A systematic search in PubMed (January 2000-October 2014); guideline databases; and Web sites of oncology, pediatric, and fertility organizations was performed. Two reviewers evaluated the quality of the identified CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II Instrument (AGREE II). From high-quality CPGs, the authors evaluated concordant and discordant areas among the recommendations. RESULTS: A total of 25 CPGs regarding fertility preservation were identified. The average AGREE II domain scores (scale of 0%-100%) varied from 15% on applicability to 100% on clarity of presentation. The authors considered 8 CPGs (32%) to be of high quality, which was defined as scores >/=60% in any 4 domains. Large variations in the recommendations of the high-quality CPGs were observed, with 87.2% and 88.6%, respectively, of discordant guideline areas among the fertility preservation recommendations for female and male patients with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Only approximately one-third of the identified CPGs were found to be of sufficient quality. Of these CPGs, the fertility preservation recommendations varied substantially, which can be a reflection of inadequate evidence for specific recommendations, thereby hindering the ability of providers to deliver high-quality care. CPGs including a transparent decision process for fertility preservation can help health care providers to deliver optimal and uniform care, thus improving the quality of life of CAYAs with cancer and cancer survivors.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about opioid prescribing among individuals who have survived cancer. Our aim is to examine a predominantly socio-economically disadvantaged population for differences in opioid prescribing rates among cancer survivors compared with matched controls without a prior diagnosis of cancer. METHODS: This was a retrospective population-wide matched cohort study. Starting in 2010, individuals residing in Ontario, Canada, who were 18 to 64 years of age and at least 5 years past their cancer diagnosis were matched to controls without a prior cancer diagnosis based on sex and calendar year of birth. Follow-up was terminated at any indication of cancer recurrence, second malignancy, or new cancer diagnosis. To examine the association between survivorship and the rate of opioid prescriptions, an Andersen-Gill recurrent event regression model was implemented, adjusting for numerous individual-level characteristics and also accounting for the matched design. RESULTS: The rate of opioid prescribing was 1.22 times higher among survivors than among their corresponding matched controls (adjusted relative rate, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.11-1.34). Individuals from lower income quintiles who were younger, were from rural neighborhoods, and had more comorbidities had significantly higher prescribing rates. Sex was not associated with prescribing rates. This increased rate of opioid prescribing was also seen among survivors who were 10 or more years past their cancer diagnosis (compared with their controls). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates substantially higher opioid prescribing rates among cancer survivors, even long after attaining survivorship. This raises concerns about the diagnosis and management of chronic pain problems among survivors stemming from their cancer diagnosis or treatment. Cancer 2017;123:4286-4293.

BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence from nationally representative samples about changes in prescription drug use for financial reasons among cancer survivors in the United States. METHODS: The 2011 to 2014 National Health Interview Survey was used to identify adults who reported ever having been told they had cancer (cancer survivors; n = 8931) and individuals without a cancer history (n = 126,287). Measures of changes in prescription drug use for financial reasons included: 1) skipping medication doses, 2) taking less medicine, 3) delaying filling a prescription, 4) asking a doctor for lower cost medication, 5) buying prescription drugs from another country, and 6) using alternative therapies. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were controlled for demographic characteristics, number of comorbid conditions, interactions between cancer history and number of comorbid conditions, and health insurance coverage. Main analyses were stratified by age (nonelderly, ages 18-64 years; elderly, ages >/=65 years) and time since diagnosis (recently diagnosed, <2 years; previously diagnosed, >/=2 years). RESULTS: Among nonelderly individuals, both recently diagnosed (31.6%) and previously diagnosed (27.9%) cancer survivors were more likely to report any change in prescription drug use for financial reasons than those without a cancer history (21.4%), with the excess percentage changes for individual measures ranging from 3.5% to 9.9% among previously diagnosed survivors and from 2.6% to 2.7% among recently diagnosed survivors (P < .01). Elderly cancer survivors and those without a cancer history had comparable rates of changes in prescription drug use for financial reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Nonelderly cancer survivors are particularly vulnerable to changes in prescription drug use for financial reasons, suggesting that targeted efforts are needed. Cancer 2017;123:1453-1463.

BACKGROUND: Testicular cancer is the most common cancer among men aged 15 to 40 years, and the incidence of testicular cancer is steadily increasing. Despite successful treatment outcomes and the rate of survival at 5 to 10 years being 95%, survivors can experience late effects of both their cancer and the treatment they received, including secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs). We discuss the development of non-germ cell SMNs that develop after diagnosis and treatment of testicular cancer and their effect on mortality. RESULTS: Patients diagnosed with testicular cancer frequently choose postoperative surveillance if they are diagnosed with clinical stage I disease. These patients may experience an increased risk for developing SMNs following radiation exposure from diagnostic imaging. Similarly, radiotherapy for testicular cancer is associated with increased risks of developing both solid tumors and leukemia. Studies have reported that patients exposed to higher doses of radiation have an increased risk of developing SMNs when compared with patients who received lower doses of radiation. Patients treated with chemotherapy also experience an increased risk of developing SMNs following testicular cancer, though the risk following chemotherapy and radiation therapy combined is not well described. A large population-based study concluded that the rate ratios for both cancer-specific and all-cause mortality for SMNs among testicular cancer survivors were not significantly different from those of matched first cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is known that patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy or who undergo routine diagnostic or follow-up imaging for a primary testicular cancer are at an increased risk for developing SMNs, the extent of this risk is largely unknown. It is critically important that research be conducted to determine this risk and its contributing factors as accurately as possible.

BACKGROUND: Cancer screening recommendations vary widely, especially for breast, prostate, and skin cancer screening. Guidelines are provided by the American Cancer Society, the US Preventive Services Task Force, and various professional organizations. The recommendations often differ with regard to age and frequency of screening. The objective of this study was to determine actual rates of screening in the primary care setting. METHODS: Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey were used. Only adult visits to non-federally employed, office-based physicians for preventive care from 2005 through 2010 were examined. Prevalence rates for breast, pelvic, and rectal examinations were calculated, along with the rates for mammograms, Papanicolaou smears, and prostate-specific antigen tests. Factors associated with screening, including age, race, smoking status, and insurance type, were examined using t tests and chi-square tests. RESULTS: In total, 8521 visits were examined. The rates of most screening examinations and tests were stable over time. Clinical breast examinations took place significantly more than mammography was ordered (54.8% vs 34.6%; P<.001). White patients received more mammography (P=.031), skin examinations (P<.010), digital rectal examinations (P<.010), and prostate-specific antigen tests (P=.003) than patients of other races. Patients who paid with Medicare or private insurance received more screening than patients who had Medicaid or no insurance (P<.010). CONCLUSIONS: Current cancer screening practices in primary care vary significantly. Cancer screening may not follow evidence-based practices and may not be targeting patients considered most at risk. Racial and socioeconomic disparities are present in cancer screening in primary care.

Immortal time bias (ITB) is still seen frequently in medical literature. However, not much is known about this bias in the field of cancer (pharmaco-)epidemiology. In context of a hypothetical beneficial beta-blocker use among cancer patients, we aimed to demonstrate the magnitude of ITB among 9876 prostate, colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancer patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2011, which were selected from a database linkage of the Netherlands Cancer Registry and the PHARMO Database Network. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals from three ITB scenarios, defining exposure at a defined point after diagnosis (model 1), at any point after diagnosis (model 2) and as multiple exposures after diagnosis (model 3), were calculated to investigate the association between beta-blockers and cancer prognosis using Cox proportional hazards regression. Results were compared to unbiased estimates derived from the Mantel-Byar model. Ignoring ITB led to substantial smaller HRs for beta-blocker use proposing a significant protective association in all cancer types [e.g. HR 0.18 (0.07-0.43) for pancreatic cancer in model 1], whereas estimates derived from the Mantel-Byar model were mainly suggesting no association [e.g. HR 1.10 (0.84-1.44)]. The magnitude of bias was consistently larger among cancer types with worse prognosis [overall median HR differences between all scenarios in model 1 and Mantel-Byar model of 0.56 (prostate), 0.72 (colorectal), 0.77 (lung) and 0.85 (pancreas)]. In conclusion, ITB led to spurious beneficial associations of beta-blocker use among cancer patients. The magnitude of ITB depends on the duration of excluded immortal time and the prognosis of each cancer.

BACKGROUND: Robust comparisons of population-based cancer survival estimates require tight adherence to the study protocol, standardized quality control, appropriate life tables of background mortality, and centralized analysis. The CONCORD program established worldwide surveillance of population-based cancer survival in 2015, analyzing individual data on 26 million patients (including 10 million US patients) diagnosed between 1995 and 2009 with 1 of 10 common malignancies. METHODS: In this Cancer supplement, we analyzed data from 37 state cancer registries that participated in the second cycle of the CONCORD program (CONCORD-2), covering approximately 80% of the US population. Data quality checks were performed in 3 consecutive phases: protocol adherence, exclusions, and editorial checks. One-, 3-, and 5-year age-standardized net survival was estimated using the Pohar Perme estimator and state- and race-specific life tables of all-cause mortality for each year. The cohort approach was adopted for patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2003, and the complete approach for patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. RESULTS: Articles in this supplement report population coverage, data quality indicators, and age-standardized 5-year net survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis. Examples of tables, bar charts, and funnel plots are provided in this article. CONCLUSIONS: Population-based cancer survival is a key measure of the overall effectiveness of services in providing equitable health care. The high quality of US cancer registry data, 80% population coverage, and use of an unbiased net survival estimator ensure that the survival trends reported in this supplement are robustly comparable by race and state. The results can be used by policymakers to identify and address inequities in cancer survival in each state and for the United States nationally. Cancer 2017;123:4982-93. Published 2017.

BACKGROUND: There is insufficient knowledge regarding the economic impact of childhood cancer on parents. The objectives of the current study were to investigate the short-term and long-term effects of childhood cancer on mothers' and fathers' income from employment and employment status. METHODS: The study sample consisted of the parents of children diagnosed with cancer from 2004 to 2009 in Sweden (3626 parents of 1899 children). Annual register data concerning income from employment and employment status (employed/not employed) were retrieved from the Longitudinal Integration Database for Health Insurance and Labor Market Studies. Using generalized linear models, the mean income from employment and employment status were compared with a matched control cohort of 34,874 parents sampled from the general population. RESULTS: Parents' income was found to decrease significantly after the child's cancer diagnosis. The effect was most pronounced for mothers, whose income was reduced for 6 years after diagnosis, whereas fathers' income was similar to that of control fathers 3 years after the diagnosis. Mothers were more likely to stop working after a child's cancer diagnosis compared with controls. No association was found for fathers' employment status. Younger age of parents; lower level of education; and, among mothers, being born outside of Sweden were found to be associated with more adverse effects on income. CONCLUSIONS: Parents' income from employment and employment status appear to be adversely affected by having a child with cancer. Socioeconomic consequences are not distributed equally: the income of fathers appears to catch up after a few years, whereas mothers tend to be disadvantaged in their professional life for several years after a child's cancer diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: The development and use of healthcare databases accentuates the need for dedicated tools, including validated selection algorithms of cancer diseased patients. As part of the development of the French National Health Insurance System data network REDSIAM, the tumor taskforce established an inventory of national and internal published algorithms in the field of cancer. This work aims to facilitate the choice of a best-suited algorithm. METHOD: A non-systematic literature search was conducted for various cancers. Results are presented for lung, breast, colon, and rectum. Medline, Scopus, the French Database in Public Health, Google Scholar, and the summaries of the main French journals in oncology and public health were searched for publications until August 2016. An extraction grid adapted to oncology was constructed and used for the extraction process. RESULTS: A total of 18 publications were selected for lung cancer, 18 for breast cancer, and 12 for colorectal cancer. Validation studies of algorithms are scarce. When information is available, the performance and choice of an algorithm are dependent on the context, purpose, and location of the planned study. Accounting for cancer disease specificity, the proposed extraction chart is more detailed than the generic chart developed for other REDSIAM taskforces, but remains easily usable in practice. CONCLUSIONS: This study illustrates the complexity of cancer detection through sole reliance on healthcare databases and the lack of validated algorithms specifically designed for this purpose. Studies that standardize and facilitate validation of these algorithms should be developed and promoted.

BACKGROUND: The medical traumatic stress model is commonly applied to childhood cancer, assuming that the diagnosis of cancer is a traumatic event. However, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding what specifically children perceive as stressful about cancer or how it compares with other stressful events more often experienced by children. METHODS: Children with cancer (254 children) and demographically similar peers without a history of serious illness (202 children) identified their most stressful life event as part of a diagnostic interview assessing for symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The events identified as most stressful were categorized thematically, with categories established separately for cancer-related and non-cancer-related events. Events also were examined to assess whether they met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) A criteria for PTSD. RESULTS: In the group of children with cancer, 54% described a cancer-related event as the most stressful event they had experienced. Six distinct categories of cancer-related events and 10 categories of non-cancer-related events were identified. The same noncancer events were identified by children in both groups, and occurred at similar frequencies. The percentage of cancer-related events that met DSM A criteria for PTSD differed dramatically depending on which version of the DSM was applied. CONCLUSIONS: Children do not necessarily view their cancer experience as their most stressful life event. The findings of the current study suggest that the diagnosis of cancer might be better viewed as a manageable stressor rather than a major trauma, and are consistent with the change in the fifth edition of the DSM to eliminate the diagnosis of a life-threatening illness as a qualifying trauma for PTSD.

Neighborhood social and built environments have been recognized as important contexts in which health is shaped. The authors reviewed the extent to which these neighborhood factors have been addressed in population-level cancer research by scanning the literature for research focused on specific social and/or built environment characteristics and their association with outcomes across the cancer continuum, including incidence, diagnosis, treatment, survivorship, and survival. The commonalities and differences in methodologies across studies, the current challenges in research methodology, and future directions in this research also were addressed. The assessment of social and built environment factors in relation to cancer is a relatively new field, with 82% of the 34 reviewed articles published since 2010. Across the wide range of social and built environment exposures and cancer outcomes considered by the studies, numerous associations were reported. However, the directions and magnitudes of associations varied, in large part because of the variation in cancer sites and outcomes studied, but also likely because of differences in study populations, geographic regions, and, importantly, choice of neighborhood measures and geographic scales. The authors recommend that future studies consider the life-course implications of cancer incidence and survival, integrate secondary and self-report data, consider work neighborhood environments, and further develop analytical and statistical approaches appropriate to the geospatial and multilevel nature of the data. Incorporating social and built environment factors into research on cancer etiology and outcomes can provide insights into disease processes, identify vulnerable populations, and generate results with translational impact of relevance for interventionists and policy makers.

This retrospective study investigated the clinical characteristics and outcomes of second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in survivors of childhood cancer from multiple institutions in Korea. A total of 102 patients from 11 institutions who developed SMN after childhood cancer treatment between 1998 and 2011 were retrospectively enrolled. The most common primary malignant neoplasms (PMNs) were central nervous system (CNS) tumors (n = 17), followed by acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n = 16), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 13), and osteosarcoma (n = 12). The most common SMNs were therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MNs; acute myeloid leukemia [AML], 29 cases; myelodysplastic syndrome [MDS], 12 cases), followed by thyroid carcinomas (n = 15) and CNS tumors (n = 10). The median latency period was 4.9 years (range, 0.5-18.5 years). Among 45 patients with solid tumors defined as an SMN, 15 (33%) developed the lesion in a field previously subjected to radiation. The 5-year overall survival (OS) rate of patients with an SMN was 45% with a median follow-up time of 8.6 years. Patients with AML, MDS, and CNS tumors exhibited the poorest outcomes with 5-year OS rates of 18%, 33%, and 32%, respectively, whereas those with second osteosarcoma showed comparable outcomes (64%) to patients with primary counterpart and those with second thyroid carcinoma had a 100% OS rate. Further therapeutic efforts are recommended to improve the survival outcomes in patients with SMNs, especially in cases with t-MNs and CNS tumors.

Hyperprolactinemia, defined as a sustained elevation of prolactin (PRL) levels greater than 530 mIU/L in women and greater than 424 mIU/L in men, has been implicated for a long time in breast cancer etiology and prognosis. Elevated PRL values (approximately 2-3 times higher than the reference values) are a common adverse effect of antipsychotic medications, especially with first-generation drugs, and most antipsychotics carry a standard warning regarding PRL elevations on their US product labels. These associations foster undertreatment of serious psychiatric illnesses in both otherwise healthy patients and cancer patients. This review assesses both the preclinical and clinical evidence that has led to the hypothesis of PRL's role in breast cancer risk or breast cancer progression. It is concluded that taken together, the published data are unconvincing and insufficient to deprive cancer patients in general and breast cancer patients specifically of potentially effective antipsychotic or antidepressant medications for serious psychiatric indications. We thus call on revised medication guidelines to avoid the existing undertreatment of serious psychiatric illnesses among cancer patients based on an unproven contraindication to psychiatric medications.

PURPOSE: Survivors of childhood cancer are at an increased risk of developing subsequent neoplasms. In long-term survivors of childhood malignancies treated with and without cranial radiation therapy (CRT), undergoing unenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, we estimated detection of intracranial neoplasms. METHODS: To investigate neurocognitive outcomes, 219 survivors of childhood cancer underwent unenhanced screening MRI of the brain. Of the survivors, 164 had been treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) (125 received CRT) and 55 for Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) (none received CRT). MRI examinations were reviewed and systematically coded by a single neuroradiologist. Demographic and treatment characteristics were compared for survivors with and without subsequent neoplasms. RESULTS: Nineteen of the 219 survivors (8.7 %) had a total of 31 subsequent intracranial neoplasms identified by neuroimaging at a median time of 25 years (range 12-46 years) from diagnosis. All neoplasms occurred after CRT, except for a single vestibular schwannoma within the cervical radiation field in a HL survivor. The prevalence of subsequent neoplasms after CRT exposure was 14.4 % (18 of 125). By noncontrast MRI, intracranial neoplasms were most suggestive of meningiomas. Most patients presented with no specific, localizing neurological complaints. In addition to the schwannoma, six tumors were resected based on results of MRI screening, all of which were meningiomas on histologic review. CONCLUSION: Unenhanced brain MRI of long-term survivors of childhood cancer detected a substantial number of intracranial neoplasms. Screening for early detection of intracranial neoplasms among aging survivors of childhood cancer who received CRT should be evaluated. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The high prevalence of incidentally detected subsequent intracranial neoplasms after CRT in long-term survivors of childhood cancer and the minimal symptoms reported by those with intracranial tumors in our study indicate that brain MRI screening of long-term survivors who received CRT may be warranted. Prospective studies of such screening are needed.

BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) causes upper and lower respiratory tract infections (URIs and LRIs, respectively) in healthy and immunocompromised patients; however, its clinical burden in patients with cancer remains unknown. METHODS: In a retrospective study of all laboratory-confirmed hMPV infections treated at the authors' institution between April 2012 and May 2015, clinical characteristics, risk factors for progression to an LRI, treatment, and outcomes in patients with cancer were determined. RESULTS: In total, 181 hMPV infections were identified in 90 patients (50%) with hematologic malignancies (HMs), in 57 (31%) hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients, and in 34 patients (19%) with solid tumors. Most patients (92%) had a community-acquired infection and presented with URIs (67%), and 43% developed LRIs (59 presented with LRIs and 19 progressed from a URI to an LRI). On multivariable analysis, an underlying HM (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 3.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-8.64; P = .029), nosocomial infection (aOR, 26.9; 95% CI, 2.79-259.75; P = .004), and hypoxia (oxygen saturation [SpO2], </= 92%) at presentation (aOR, 9.61; 95% CI, 1.98-46.57; P = .005) were identified as independent factors associated with LRI. All-cause mortality at 30 days from hMPV diagnosis was low (4%), and patients with LRIs had a 10% mortality rate at day 30 from diagnosis; whereas patients with URIs had a 0% mortality rate. CONCLUSIONS: hMPV infections in patients with cancer may cause significant morbidity, especially for those with underlying HM who may develop an LRI. Despite high morbidity and the lack of directed antiviral therapy for hMPV infections, mortality at day 30 from this infection remained low in this studied population. Cancer 2017;123:2329-2337.

BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether immunosuppression results in more aggressive, advanced stage cancers. Because cancer stage is influenced both by tumor biology and medical surveillance, the authors assessed cancer stage in individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and solid organ transplant recipients, 2 immunosuppressed groups with differences in their health care use. METHODS: The authors used data on all cases of 15 cancer types diagnosed during 1996 through 2010 in 2 studies that linked US cancer registries with HIV and transplant registries. Odds ratios (ORs) for advanced (vs local) disease were estimated comparing HIV and transplant populations with immunocompetent individuals in polytomous logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, race, registry, and year. RESULTS: A total of 8411 of 4.5 million cancer cases occurred in HIV-infected individuals and 7322 of 6.4 million cancer cases occurred in transplant recipients. Compared with immunocompetent patients with cancer, those infected with HIV were more likely to be diagnosed with distant stage lung (OR, 1.13), female breast (OR, 1.99), and prostate (OR, 1.57) cancers, whereas transplant recipients had fewer distant stage lung (OR, 0.54), female breast (OR, 0.75), and prostate (OR, 0.72) cancers. Both immunosuppressed populations had a shift toward advanced stage melanoma (ORs of 1.97 for HIV-infected individuals and 1.82 for transplant recipients) and bladder cancer (ORs of 1.42 for HIV-infected individuals and 1.54 for transplant recipients). CONCLUSIONS: Bladder cancer and melanoma were more likely to be diagnosed at a nonlocal stage in both HIV-infected individuals and transplant recipients, suggesting a role for immunosuppression in their progression. In addition, we observed a shift for some common cancers toward later stages in HIV-infected individuals and toward earlier stages in transplant recipients, which is consistent with differential access to medical care or surveillance.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of cancer is an age-related phenomenon; therefore, the interest on clinical manifestations, diagnostic approach and treatment strategies for older patients diagnosed with cancer has increased lately. Neurologic symptoms are one of the main reasons for consultation and a common cause of decreased quality of life among cancer patients. AIMS: To identify the neurologic manifestations of patients >/= 65 years of age diagnosed with cancer and compare them to those presented by a younger population. METHODS: Cross-sectional study of cancer patients referred to neuro-oncologic consultation at a Cancer Center. Sociodemographic, health and oncologic characteristics were obtained through clinical interviews. Clinical symptoms and final diagnoses were also recorded. Bivariate logistic regression analyses were carried out. RESULTS: More than 17,000 neuro-oncologic consultations in 3015 patients were given, 27% (n = 811) of them were >/= 65 years of age. Most frequent primary neoplasms in elderly patients were: breast cancer, hematologic neoplasms, gynecological, urologic, skin and head and neck cancers. Elderly patients had an increased risk of having the following diagnoses: abnormal movements, stroke, peripheral vertigo, dementia, degenerative spine disorder, and delirium. DISCUSSION: Elderly patients are considered a vulnerable population. The present study found that the main neoplasms associated with neurological manifestations are similar to the reported previously. We described the main symptoms that led to a neuro-oncological assessment. Moreover, we enlisted the final diagnoses made on elderly patients and compared them with others reports. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides valuable information, since there is scarce evidence in the literature about this topic. CONCLUSION: Identifying the frequency and correlation of neurologic manifestations in older cancer patients will allow for the implementation of timely multidisciplinary care in an attempt to improve these patients' health-related quality of life.

BACKGROUND: The purpose was to describe the development of subsequent malignant neoplasms (SMN) among a population-based cohort of pediatric cancer patients, with a focus on SMNs that occurred within the first 5 years from diagnosis. METHODS: The cohort was identified from POGONIS, an active provincial registry. Cohort members were Ontario residents ages 0 to 14.9 years at primary diagnosis between January 1985 and December 2008. SMNs that developed <18 years were captured by POGONIS, whereas SMNs diagnosed later were identified through linkage. Cumulative incidence and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) were calculated, and proportional hazards models were estimated to examine factors associated with SMN development. RESULTS: A total of 7,920 patients were eligible. 2.4% (188/7,920) developed 197 SMNs. Mean follow-up time was 10.7 years (SD = 7.6 years; range, 0.0-26.4 years) with mean time to SMN of 8.5 years (SD = 6.3 years; range, 0.0-24.9 years). The SIR for the development of a SMN was 9.9 [95% confidence interval (CI), 8.6-11.4]. 40.6% of SMNs (80/197) developed within 5 years. Early SMNs were more likely to be leukemia and lymphoma. Factors associated with early SMN were primary diagnosis of a bone tumor (OR, 4.88; 95% CI, 1.52-15.60), exposure to radiotherapy (OR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.02-3.22), and the highest dose of epipodophyllotoxin (OR, 3.74; 95% CI, 1.88-7.42). CONCLUSIONS: Over 40% of SMNs diagnosed in childhood cancer patients occurred in the first 5 years after diagnosis, suggesting a need for early and ongoing surveillance. IMPACT: The early development of certain SMNs reinforces the need for early and continued surveillance at all stages for pediatric cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Data are limited on the use and outcomes of urine drug tests (UDTs) among patients with advanced cancer. The main objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with UDT ordering and results in outpatients with advanced cancer. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted of 1058 patients who attended an outpatient supportive care clinic from March 2014 to November 2015. Sixty-one patients who were receiving chronic opioid therapy and underwent UDTs were identified. A control group of 120 patients who did not undergo UDTs was selected for comparison. RESULTS: Sixty-one of 1058 patients (6%) underwent UDTs, and 33 of 61 patients (54%) had abnormal results. Multivariate analysis indicated that the odds ratio for UDT ordering was 3.9 in patients who had positive Cut Down, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye Opener (CAGE) questionnaire results (P = .002), 4.41 in patients aged < 45 years (P < .001), 5.58 in patients who had moderate-to-severe pain (Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale pain scores >/=4; P < .001), 0.27 in patients with advanced-stage cancer, (P = .008), and 0.25 in patients who had moderate-to-severe fatigue (P = .001). Among 52 abnormal UDT results in 33 patients, the most common opioid findings were prescribed opioids absent in urine (14 of 52 tests; 27%) and unprescribed opioids in urine (13 of 52 tests; 25%). CONCLUSIONS: UDTs were used infrequently among outpatients with advanced cancer who were receiving chronic opioid therapy. Younger age, positive CAGE questionnaire results, early stage cancer or no evidence of disease status, higher pain intensity, and lower fatigue scores were significant predictors of UDT ordering. More than 50% of UDT results were abnormal. More research is necessary to better characterize aberrant opioid use in patients with advanced cancer. Cancer 2016;122:3732-9.

Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a sub-population of tumour cells, which are responsible to drive tumour growth, metastasis and therapy resistance. It has recently been proposed that enhanced glucose metabolism and immune evasion by tumour cells are linked, and are modulated by the changing tumour microenvironment (TME) that creates a competition for nutrient consumption between tumour and different sub-types of cells attracted to the TME. To facilitate efficient nutrient distribution, oncogene-induced inflammatory milieu in the tumours facilitate adaptive metabolic changes in the surrounding non-malignant cells to secrete metabolites that are used as alternative nutrient sources by the tumours to sustain its increasing energy needs for growth and anabolic functions. This scenario also affects CSCs residing at the primary or metastatic niches. This review summarises recent advances in our understanding of the metabolic phenotypes of cancer cells and CSCs and how these processes are affected by the TME. We also discuss how the evolving TME modulates tumour cells and CSCs in cancer progression. Using previously described proteomic and genomic platforms, ovarian cancer cell lines and a mouse xenograft model we highlight the existence of metabolic and immune regulatory signatures in chemoresistant ovarian CSCs, and discuss how these processes may affect recurrence in ovarian tumours. We propose that progress in cancer control and eradication may depend not only on the elimination of highly chemoresistant CSCs, but also in designing novel strategies which would intervene with the tumour-promoting TME factors.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate whether stage at cancer diagnosis differed according to patient economic status. METHODS: A total of 10,528 patients with cancer of the stomach, colorectum, breast, or cervix, which are target organs of the Korean National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP; fully implemented in 2005) were extracted from population-based cancer registries. The patients were classified into four groups based on socioeconomic status (SES), as determined using their National Health Insurance (NHI) monthly premium at the time of cancer diagnosis. Cancer stage at diagnosis was defined as early (in situ/local) or late stage (regional/distant) based on the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) summary stage. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to estimate the risk of non-local stage using age, residential area, and community deprivation index as covariates. RESULTS: The lowest SES subjects showed significantly higher risks of being diagnosed at a later stage for stomach, colorectal, and female breast cancer, but not for cervical cancer, compared with the highest SES subjects. The estimated ORs were 1.28 (95% CI, 1.10-1.49), 1.29 (95% CI, 1.03-1.61), and 1.35 (95% CI, 1.02-1.81) in the lowest SES subjects with stomach, colorectal, and breast cancer, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, later stage diagnoses of stomach, colon, and female breast cancer are still associated with SES in Korea in the era of the NCSP for the lower SES population.

Background/aim: Cancer patients frequently need intensive care support due to respiratory failure. We aimed to evaluate the predictors of mortality in cancer patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Materials and methods: This study was performed in the ICUs of two centers between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2015. Demographic data, cancer type, causes of respiratory failure, comorbidities, APACHE II scores, treatments, and mortality rates were recorded. Results: A total number of 583 cancer patients (477 males) were enrolled from the two centers. Of those, 472 patients had lung cancer (81%), while 111 had extrapulmonary malignancies (19%), having similar mortality rates. Causes of respiratory failure were mostly invasion of the cancer itself in 84% of cases and due to infection in 12%. ICU mortality rate was 53% and the 1-year mortality rate was 80%. APACHE II scores were significantly higher in nonsurvivors (P < 0.001). One-year survival was found to be significantly shorter in females than males (9 days vs. 12 days) in patients with lung cancer. Conclusion: Mortality rates of cancer patients who need ICU support are higher than overall ICU mortality. High APACHE II scores and female sex seem to be related to mortality in these patients.

Objective: To analyze the data of malignant tumor mortality and change in disease burden in Hebei province from 1973 to 2013. Methods: Cancer mortality rate, age-standardized mortality rate and the years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) were calculated by using the data from three rounds of all death causes survey and database of cancer registry in Hebei during 1973-2013. Results: From 1973 to 2013, a linear upward of malignant tumor mortality was observed, with a 51.57% increase. The mortality rate during 1973-1975 was 98.52/100 000 and it was 149.33/100 000 during 2011-2013. During 1973-1975, the YLLs was 17.0/1 000 in males and 12.8/1 000 in females. While during 2011-2013, the YLLs was 23.2/1 000 in males and 15.9/1 000 in females. During 1973-1975, esophagus cancer, stomach cancer and liver cancer were top three leading causes of deaths. During 2011-2013, lung cancer, stomach cancer and liver cancer were main leading causes of deaths. During the past 40 years, the deaths of esophagus cancer and cervix cancer decreased dramatically, but the deaths of lung cancer and breast cancer increased sharply. Conclusions: The disease burden caused by malignant tumor is becoming more serious in Hebei. It is necessary to strengthen the primary prevention and screening of malignant tumor.

OBJECTIVES: Population-based evidence regarding impact of cancer screenings and cancer rates in Missouri is lacking. This study examined whether screenings of breast cancer, cervical cancer, and colorectal cancer impact early-stage cancer incidence and mortality in Missouri. STUDY DESIGN: This is an ecological study based on county-specific estimates of selected cancer screening prevalence and early-stage cancer incidence and cancer mortality. METHODS: County-specific prevalence of clinical breast examination, mammography, Pap test, sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, and fecal occult blood test (FOBT) were generated from Missouri County-Level Study (2003, 2007, and 2011). County-specific crude incidence and mortality were calculated (2004-2013). Pearson's correlation and Poisson regression were used to test association between cancer rate and screening prevalence. Covariates included county-level mean age, percentage of whites, percentage with low income, percentage with less than high school education high school, percentage with no insurance, and percentage having difficulties accessing care. RESULTS: In the adjusted model, 'ever had Pap test' was significantly associated with an increase of 8% in early-stage cervical cancer incidence. Having clinical breast examination or Pap test in the past was also associated with decreases in mortality by 3% and 4%, respectively, although the association was not significant for Pap test. In addition, having mammography was statistically significantly associated with early-stage breast cancer incidence, and having FOBT or sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy was associated with decreased colorectal cancer mortality; however, magnitude for these associations was only around 1%. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides ecological evidence of the effectiveness of screening services in predicting early stage cancer incidence and in reducing mortality across Missouri counties. Further incentive to promote these screenings in Missouri is needed.

BACKGROUND: When bad news about a cancer diagnosis is being delivered, patient-centered communication (PCC) has been considered important for patients' adjustment and well-being. However, few studies have explored how interpersonal skills might help cancer patients cope with anxiety and distress during bad-news encounters. METHODS: A prospective, experimental design was used to investigate the impact of the physician communication style during a bad-news encounter. Ninety-eight cancer patients and 92 unaffected subjects of both sexes were randomly assigned to view a video of a clinician delivering a first cancer diagnosis with either an enhanced patient-centered communication (E-PCC) style or a low patient-centered communication (L-PCC) style. Participants rated state anxiety and negative affect before and immediately after the video exposure, whereas trust in the physician was rated after the video exposure only. Main and interaction effects were analyzed with generalized linear models. RESULTS: Viewing the disclosure of a cancer diagnosis resulted in a substantial increase in state anxiety and negative affect among all participants. This emotional response was moderated by the physician's communication style: Participants viewing an oncologist displaying an E-PCC style were significantly less anxious than those watching an oncologist displaying an L-PCC style. They also reported significantly higher trust in the physician. CONCLUSIONS: Under a threatening, anxiety-provoking disclosure of bad news, a short sequence of empathic PCC influences subjects' psychological state, insofar that they report feeling less anxious and more trustful of the oncologist. Video exposure appears to be a valuable method for investigating the impact of a physician's communication style during critical encounters. Cancer 2017;123:3167-75.

BACKGROUND: The Affordable Care Act (ACA) includes a mandate requiring most private health insurers to cover routine patient care costs for cancer clinical trial participation; however, the impact of this provision on cancer centers' efforts to accrue patients to clinical trials has not been well described. METHODS: First, members of cancer research centers and community-based institutions (n = 252) were surveyed to assess the status of insurance denials, and then, a focused survey (n = 77) collected denial details. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to examine associations between the receipt of denials and site characteristics. RESULTS: Overall, 62.7% of the initial survey respondents reported at least 1 insurance denial during 2014. Sites using a precertification process were 3.04 times more likely to experience denials (95% confidence interval, 1.55-5.99; P </= .001), and similar rates of denials were reported from sites located in states with preexisting clinical trial coverage laws versus states without them (82.3% vs 85.1%; chi = 50.7; P </= .001). Among the focused survey sites, academic centers reported denials more often than community sites (71.4% vs 46.4%). The failure of plans to cover trial participation was cited as the most common reason provided for denials (n = 33 [80.5%]), with nearly 80% of sites (n = 61) not receiving a coverage response from the insurer within 72 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the ACA's mandate for most insurers to cover routine care costs for cancer clinical trial participation, denials and delays continue. Denials may continue because some insurers remain exempt from the law, or they may signal an implementation failure. Delays in coverage may affect patient participation in trials. Additional efforts to eliminate this barrier will be needed to achieve federal initiatives to double the pace of cancer research over the next 5 years. Future work should assess the law's effectiveness at the patient level to inform these efforts. Cancer 2017;123:2893-900. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

Objective: To estimate the cancer incidence and mortality in elderly Chinese population in 2013 based on the data from local cancer registries submitted to National Central Cancer Registry (NCCR). Methods: Data from 255 cancer registries submitted to NCCR with qualified data after checked and evaluated, were selected for this estimation. Cancer incidence and mortality were stratified by areas, sex, age groups and cancer site, combined with population data of the year 2013 to estimate cancer epidemiology in older people in China. Chinese population census in 2000 and Segi's population were used for the estimation of age-standardized incidence/mortality rates. Results: All the 255 cancer registries (88 in urban and 167 in rural areas) were selected for this estimation, covered 37 407 728 elderly subjects, accounting for 17.73% of the entire national elderly population. It was estimated about 2 171.0 thousand new cancer cases in older people in China, accounting for 58.96% of all cancer incidence, with the crude incidence rate of 1 029.16/100 000 (1 297.96 per 100 000 in male, 777.18 per 100 000 in female), and the age-standardized incidence rate by Chinese standard population (ASIRC, 2000) was 1 019.25 per 100 000. It was estimated about 1 600.5 thousand deaths in older people in China, accounting for 67.70% of all cancer deaths, with the crude mortality of 758.72/100 000 (988.37 per 100 000 in males, 543.44 per 100 000 in females), and the age-standardized incidence rate by Chinese standard population (ASIRC, 2000) was 730.78 per 100 000. Lung cancer, stomach cancer, colorectal cancer, liver cancer and esophageal cancer were the most common cancers, accounting for about 67.70% of all cancer cases in China. Those cancers are also the most common cancers in China, accounting for about 73.45% of all cancer deaths. Conclusions: The cancer burden of elderly population in China is very serious. The major cancer incidence and mortality in urban and rural areas are similar, but the cancer patterns are very different in urban and rural areas. As cancer burdens for older people are different between urban and rural areas in China, more attention should be paid to the need of older people according to the actual situation.

In May 2015, the Cancer and Aging Research Group, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute on Aging through a U13 grant, convened a conference to identify research priorities to help design and implement intervention studies to improve the quality of life and survivorship of older, frailer adults with cancer. Conference attendees included researchers with multidisciplinary expertise and advocates. It was concluded that future intervention trials for older adults with cancer should: 1) rigorously test interventions to prevent the decline of or improve health status, especially interventions focused on optimizing physical performance, nutritional status, and cognition while undergoing cancer treatment; 2) use standardized care plans based on geriatric assessment findings to guide targeted interventions; and 3) incorporate the principles of geriatrics into survivorship care plans. Also highlighted was the need to integrate the expertise of interdisciplinary team members into geriatric oncology research, improve funding mechanisms to support geriatric oncology research, and disseminate high-impact results to the research and clinical community. In conjunction with the 2 prior U13 meetings, this conference provided the framework for future research to improve the evidence base for the clinical care of older adults with cancer.

BACKGROUND: microRNAs (miRNAs) stably exist in circulating blood and are encapsulated in extracellular vesicles such as exosomes. The aims of this study were to identify which exosomal miRNAs are highly produced from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cells, to analyze whether serum miRNA can be used to discriminate patients with EOC from healthy volunteers, and to investigate the functional role of exosomal miRNAs in ovarian cancer progression. METHODS: Exosomes were collected from the culture media of serous ovarian cancer cell lines, namely TYK-nu and HeyA8 cells. An exosomal miRNA microarray revealed that several miRNAs including miR-99a-5p were specifically elevated in EOC-derived exosomes. Expression levels of serum miR-99a-5p in 62 patients with EOC, 26 patients with benign ovarian tumors, and 20 healthy volunteers were determined by miRNA quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. To investigate the role of exosomal miR-99a-5p in peritoneal dissemination, neighboring human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) were treated with EOC-derived exosomes and then expression levels of miR-99a-5p were examined. Furthermore, mimics of miR-99a-5p were transfected into HPMCs and the effect of miR-99a-5p on cancer invasion was analyzed using a 3D culture model. Proteomic analysis with the tandem mass tag method was performed on HPMCs transfected with miR-99a-5p and then potential target genes of miR-99a-5p were examined. RESULTS: The serum miR-99a-5p levels were significantly increased in patients with EOC, compared with those in benign tumor patients and healthy volunteers (1.7-fold and 2.8-fold, respectively). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed with a cut-off of 1.41 showed sensitivity and specificity of 0.85 and 0.75, respectively, for detecting EOC (area under the curve = 0.88). Serum miR-99a-5p expression levels were significantly decreased after EOC surgeries (1.8 to 1.3, p = 0.002), indicating that miR-99a-5p reflects tumor burden. Treatment with EOC-derived exosomes significantly increased miR-99a-5p expression in HPMCs. HPMCs transfected with miR-99a-5p promoted ovarian cancer invasion and exhibited increased expression levels of fibronectin and vitronectin. CONCLUSIONS: Serum miR-99a-5p is significantly elevated in ovarian cancer patients. Exosomal miR-99a-5p from EOC cells promotes cell invasion by affecting HPMCs through fibronectin and vitronectin upregulation and may serve as a target for inhibiting ovarian cancer progression.

PURPOSE: Adolescents and young adults (AYA) with cancer comprise an intermediate age group between pediatric and adult oncology, and have a spectrum of different types of cancers. Survival among this group has not improved as much as in younger children with cancer. The aim of this study was evaluate the trends in cancer mortality of AYA aged 15-29 years in Brazil. METHODS: Data were extracted from the Atlas of Cancer Mortality databases from 1979 to 2013. Age-specific mortality rates were calculated based on the deaths from each type of cancer and the period via a direct method using the proposed world population age groups. To identify significant changes in the trends, we performed joinpoint regression analysis. RESULTS: The mortality rates per million were 54 deaths in those aged 15-19 years, 61 deaths in those aged 20-24 years, and 88 deaths in those aged 25-29 years. Leukemias, lymphomas, and central nervous system (CNS) tumors occurred at high rates in all age groups. Rates of cervical cancer were highest in those aged 25-29 years. There were significant increases in mortality trends in the North and Northeast regions for all tumor groups, especially CNS tumors. A small decrease in the mortality rate from lymphomas was observed in the South and Southeast regions. CONCLUSION: Mortality in Brazilian AYA was slightly higher than in other studies conducted throughout the world. When separated by tumor type, Brazil presents a specific pattern, with high mortality from cervical cancer.

AIM: Cancer mortality distribution was investigated by detailed neoplasms groups, age, sex, marital status of deceased, and regions in the Slovak Republic, and examined how these determinants influence the odds of dying due to cancer. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of cancer mortality statistics registered in the Slovak Republic during the years 1996-2014. For this time period, data was available only on the underlying subgroups of cancer deaths, place of death, age, year, sex, and marital status. Binary logistic regression was applied for odds of dying calculation influenced by these socio-demographic factors. RESULTS: The most common are deaths from malignant neoplasms of digestive organs in males as well as females. The biggest difference among both genders is recognized in malignant neoplasms of lip, oral cavity and pharynx, where deaths among males are on average 7.9 times higher in comparison to females. As for place of death the Bratislava region reports the highest level of cancer mortality stated at 25.22% of all deaths, on the contrary the Banska Bystrica region reports only 21.40% of all deaths. Age has a negative influence on odds of dying due to neoplasms compared to all other causes of death by 1.7%. In all regions compared to the reference Bratislava region, the odds of dying from neoplasms are lower. Being female diminishes the odds of dying due to neoplasms by 25.7% compared to males. Yearly the relative ratio of dying from neoplasms increases with respect to all other causes of death. When single people are set as the reference category, the relation of the probability of death from cancer to the probability of death due to other causes of death is higher for married, divorced and widowed persons. CONCLUSIONS: The results should be taken into account when comparing risk of dying due to cancer among people with the mentioned sociodemographic characteristics. Health policy makers should consider place of death and cancer types while planning hospital care units.

Context: Growth hormone (GH) is prescribed for an increasing range of indications, but there has been concern that it might raise cancer risk. Published data are limited. Objective: To examine cancer risks in relation to GH treatment. Design: Cohort study. Setting: Population-based. Patients: Cohort of 23,984 patients treated with recombinant human GH (r-hGH) in eight European countries since this treatment was first used in 1984. Cancer expectations from country-specific national population statistics. Main Outcome Measures: Cancer incidence and cancer mortality. Results: Incidence and mortality risks in the cohort were raised for several cancer sites, largely consequent on second primary malignancies in patients given r-hGH after cancer treatment. There was no clear raised risk in patients with growth failure without other major disease. Only for bone and bladder cancers was incidence significantly raised in GH-treated patients without previous cancer. Cancer risk was unrelated to duration or cumulative dose of r-hGH treatment, but for patients treated after previous cancer, cancer mortality risk increased significantly with increasing daily r-hGH dose (P trend < 0.001). Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) incidence increased significantly with longer follow-up (P trend = 0.001 for patients overall and 0.002 for patients without previous cancer). Conclusions: Our results do not generally support a carcinogenic effect of r-hGH, but the unexplained trend in cancer mortality risk in relation to GH dose in patients with previous cancer, and the indication of possible effects on bone cancer, bladder cancer, and HL risks, need further investigation.

BACKGROUND: Individuals from disadvantaged communities are among the millions of uninsured Americans gaining insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The extent to which health insurance can mitigate the effects of the social determinants of health on cancer care is unknown. METHODS: This study linked the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries to US Census data to study patients diagnosed with the 4 leading causes of cancer deaths between 2007 and 2011. A county-level social determinant score was developed with 5 measures of wealth, education, and employment. Patients were stratified into quintiles, with the lowest quintile representing the most disadvantaged communities. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate associations and cancer-specific survival. RESULTS: A total of 364,507 patients aged 18 to 64 years were identified (134,105 with breast cancer, 106,914 with prostate cancer, 62,606 with lung cancer, and 60,882 with colorectal cancer). Overall, patients from the most disadvantaged communities (median household income, $42,885; patients below the poverty level, 22%; patients completing college, 17%) were more likely to present with distant disease (odds ratio, 1.6; P < .001) and were less likely to receive cancer-directed surgery (odds ratio, 0.8; P < .001) than the least disadvantaged communities (median income, $78,249; patients below the poverty level, 9%; patients completing college, 42%). The differences persisted across quintiles regardless of the insurance status. The effect of having insurance on cancer-specific survival was more pronounced in disadvantaged communities (relative benefit at 3 years, 40% vs 31%). However, it did not fully mitigate the effect of social determinants on mortality (hazard ratio, 0.75 vs 0.68; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer patients from disadvantaged communities benefit most from health insurance, and there is a reduction in disparities in outcome. However, the gap produced by social determinants of health cannot be bridged by insurance alone. Cancer 2017;123:1219-1227. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of metachronous colorectal cancer (MCRC) among colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors varies significantly, and the optimal colonoscopy surveillance practice for mitigating MCRC incidence is unknown. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was used to compare the performances of the US Multi-Society Task Force guideline and all clinically reasonable colonoscopy surveillance strategies for 50- to 79-year-old posttreatment CRC patients with a computer simulation model. RESULTS: The US guideline [(1,3,5)] recommends the first colonoscopy 1 year after treatment, whereas the second and third colonoscopies are to be repeated at 3- and 5-year intervals. Some promising alternative cost-effective strategies were identified. In comparison with the US guideline, under various scenarios for a 20-year period, 1) reducing the surveillance interval of the guideline after the first colonoscopy by 1 year [(1,2,5)] would save up to 78 discounted life-years (LYs) and prevent 23 MCRCs per 1000 patients (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] </= $23,270/LY), 2) reducing the intervals after the first and second negative colonoscopies by 1 year [(1,2,4)] would save/prevent up to 109 discounted LYs and 36 MCRCs (ICER </= $52,155/LY), and 3) reducing the surveillance intervals after the first and second negative colonoscopy by 1 and 2 years [(1,2,3)] would save/prevent up to 141 discounted LYs and 50 MCRCs (ICER </= $63,822/LY). These strategies would require up to 1100 additional colonoscopies per 1000 patients. Although the US guideline might not be cost-effective in comparison with a less intensive oncology guideline [(3,3,5); the ICER could be as high as $140,000/LY], the promising strategies would be cost-effective in comparison with such less intensive guidelines unless the cumulative MCRC incidence were very low. CONCLUSIONS: The US guideline might be improved by a slight increase in the surveillance intensity at the expense of moderately increased cost. More research is warranted to explore the benefits/harms of such practices. Cancer 2016;122:2560-70. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) ages 15 to 39 years with cancer continue to experience disparate survival outcomes compared with their younger and older counterparts. This may be caused in part by differential access to specialized cancer centers (SCCs), because treatment at SCCs has been associated with improved overall survival. The authors examined social and clinical factors associated with AYA use of SCCs (defined as Children's Oncology Group-designated or National Cancer Institute-designated centers). METHODS: A retrospective, population-based analysis was performed on all hospital admissions of AYA oncology patients in California during 1991 through 2014 (n = 127,250) using the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development database. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined the contribution of social and clinical factors on always receiving care from an SCC (vs sometimes or never). Results are presented as adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: Over the past 20 years, the percentage of patients always receiving inpatient care at an SCC increased over time (from 27% in 1991 to 43% in 2014). In multivariable regression analyses, AYA patients were less likely to always receive care from an SCC if they had public insurance (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.62-0.66), were uninsured (OR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.46-0.56), were Hispanic (OR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.85-0.91), lived > 5 miles from an SCC, or had a diagnosis other than leukemia and central nervous system tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Receiving care at an SCC was influenced by insurance, race/ethnicity, geography, and tumor type. Identifying the barriers associated with decreased SCC use is an important first step toward improving outcomes in AYA oncology patients. Cancer 2017;123:2516-23. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Women diagnosed with lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) have a 3-fold to 10-fold increased risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the life expectancy (LE) and differences in survival offered by active surveillance, risk-reducing chemoprevention, and bilateral prophylactic mastectomy among women with LCIS. METHODS: A Markov simulation model was constructed to determine average LE and quality-adjusted LE (QALE) gains for hypothetical cohorts of women diagnosed with LCIS at various ages under alternative risk-reduction strategies. Probabilities for invasive breast cancer, breast cancer-specific mortality, other-cause mortality and the effectiveness of preventive strategies were derived from published studies and from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. RESULTS: Assuming a breast cancer incidence from 1.02% to 1.37% per year under active surveillance, a woman aged 50 years diagnosed with LCIS would have a total LE of 32.78 years and would gain 0.13 years (1.6 months) in LE by adding chemoprevention and 0.25 years (3.0 months) in LE by adding bilateral prophylactic mastectomy. After quality adjustment, chemoprevention resulted in the greatest QALE for women ages 40 to 60 years at LCIS diagnosis, whereas surveillance remained the preferred strategy for optimizing QALE among women diagnosed at age 65 years and older. CONCLUSIONS: In this model, among women with a diagnosis of LCIS, breast cancer prevention strategies only modestly affected overall survival, whereas chemoprevention was modeled as the preferred management strategy for optimizing invasive disease-free survival while prolonging QALE form women younger than 65 years.

BACKGROUND: Prospective cohort studies contribute importantly to understanding the role of lifestyle, genetic, and other factors in chronic disease etiology. METHODS: The American Cancer Society (ACS) recruited a new prospective cohort study, Cancer Prevention Study 3 (CPS-3), between 2006 and 2013 from 35 states and Puerto Rico. Enrollment took place primarily at ACS community events and at community enrollment "drives." At enrollment sites, participants completed a brief survey that included an informed consent, identifying information necessary for follow-up, and key exposure information. They also provided a waist measure and a nonfasting blood sample. Most participants also completed a more comprehensive baseline survey at home that included extensive medical, lifestyle, and other information. Participants will be followed for incident cancers through linkage with state cancer registries and for cause-specific mortality through linkage with the National Death Index. RESULTS: In total, 303,682 participants were enrolled. Of these, 254,650 completed the baseline survey and are considered "fully" enrolled; they will be sent repeat surveys periodically for at least the next 20 years to update exposure information. The remaining participants (n = 49,032) will not be asked to update exposure information but will be followed for outcomes. Twenty-three percent of participants were men, 17.3% reported a race or ethnicity other than "white," and the median age at enrollment was 47 years. CONCLUSIONS: CPS-3 will be a valuable resource for studies of cancer and other outcomes because of its size; its diversity with respect to age, ethnicity, and geography; and the availability of blood samples and detailed questionnaire information collected over time.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the source of advanced cancer patients' information about their prognosis and determine whether this source of information could explain racial disparities in the accuracy of patients' life expectancy estimates (LEEs). METHODS: Coping With Cancer was a prospective, longitudinal, multisite study of terminally ill cancer patients followed until death. In structured interviews, patients reported their LEEs and the sources of these estimates (ie, medical providers, personal beliefs, religious beliefs, and other). The accuracy of LEEs was calculated through a comparison of patients' self-reported LEEs with their actual survival. RESULTS: The sample for this analysis included 229 patients: 31 black patients and 198 white patients. Only 39.30% of the patients estimated their life expectancy within 12 months of their actual survival. Black patients were more likely to have an inaccurate LEE than white patients. A minority of the sample (18.3%) reported that a medical provider was the source of their LEEs; none of the black patients (0%) based their LEEs on a medical provider. Black race remained a significant predictor of an inaccurate LEE, even after the analysis had been controlled for sociodemographic characteristics and the source of LEEs. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of advanced cancer patients have an inaccurate understanding of their life expectancy. Black patients with advanced cancer are more likely to have an inaccurate LEE than white patients. Medical providers are not the source of information for LEEs for most advanced cancer patients and especially for black patients. The source of LEEs does not explain racial differences in LEE accuracy. Additional research into the mechanisms underlying racial differences in prognostic understanding is needed.

BACKGROUND: Previous work on difficult relationships between patients and physicians has largely focused on the adult primary care setting and has typically held patients responsible for challenges. Little is known about experiences in pediatrics and more serious illness; therefore, we examined difficult relationships between parents and physicians of children with cancer. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional, semistructured interview study of parents and physicians of children with cancer at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Boston Children's Hospital (Boston, Mass) in longitudinal primary oncology relationships in which the parent, physician, or both considered the relationship difficult. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and subjected to a content analysis. RESULTS: Dyadic parent and physician interviews were performed for 29 relationships. Twenty were experienced as difficult by both parents and physicians; 1 was experienced as difficult by the parent only; and 8 were experienced as difficult by the physician only. Parent experiences of difficult relationships were characterized by an impaired therapeutic alliance with physicians; physicians experienced difficult relationships as demanding. Core underlying issues included problems of connection and understanding (n = 8), confrontational parental advocacy (n = 16), mental health issues (n = 2), and structural challenges to care (n = 3). Although problems of connection and understanding often improved over time, problems of confrontational advocacy tended to solidify. Parents and physicians both experienced difficult relationships as highly distressing. CONCLUSIONS: Although prior conceptions of difficult relationships have held patients responsible for challenges, this study has found that difficult relationships follow several patterns. Some challenges, such as problems of connection and understanding, offer an opportunity for healing. However, confrontational advocacy appears especially refractory to repair; special consideration of these relationships and avenues for repairing them are needed. Cancer 2017;123:675-681.

Relatives of cancer patients are at an increased risk of the same (concordant) cancer but whether they are at a risk for different (discordant) cancers is largely unknown - beyond well characterized hereditary cancer syndromes - but would be of major scientific and clinical interest. We therefore decided to resolve the issue by analyzing familial risks when family members were diagnosed with any discordant cancers. We compared the population impact of concordant to discordant familial cancer. The Swedish Family-Cancer Database (FCD) was used to calculate familial relative risks (RRs) for family members of cancer patients, for the 27 most common cancers. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were estimated for concordant and discordant family histories. Discordant cancers in the family were detected as significant risk factors for the majority of cancers, although the corresponding RRs were modest compared to RRs for concordant cancers. Risks increased with the number of affected family members with the highest RRs for pancreatic (2.31), lung (1.69), kidney (1.98), nervous system (1.79) and thyroid cancers (3.28), when 5 or more family members were diagnosed with discordant cancers. For most cancers, the PAF for discordant family history exceeded that for concordant family history. Our findings suggest that there is an unspecific genetic predisposition to cancer with clinical consequences. We consider it unlikely that shared environmental risk factors could essentially contribute to the risks for diverse discordant cancers, which are likely driven by genetic predisposition. The identification of genes that moderately increase the risk for many cancers will be a challenge.

BACKGROUND: Health complications related to childhood cancer may be influenced by risky health behaviors (RHBs), particularly when RHBs co-occur. To the authors' knowledge, only limited information is available describing how RHBs cluster among survivors of childhood cancer and their siblings and the risk factors for co-occurring RHBs. METHODS: Latent class analysis was used to identify RHB clusters using longitudinal survey data regarding smoking, alcohol use, and physical activity from adult survivors (4184 survivors) and siblings (1598 siblings) in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. Generalized logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between demographic characteristics, treatment exposures, psychological distress, health conditions, and cluster membership. RESULTS: Three RHB clusters were identified: a low-risk cluster, an insufficiently active cluster, and a high-risk cluster (tobacco and risky alcohol use and insufficient activity). Compared with siblings, survivors were more likely to be in the insufficiently active cluster (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj ], 1.17; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.06-1.27) and were less likely to be in the high-risk cluster (ORadj , 0.79; 95% CI, 0.69-0.88). Risk factors for membership in the high-risk cluster included psychological distress (ORadj , 2.76; 95% CI, 1.98-3.86), low educational attainment (ORadj , 7.49; 95% CI, 5.15-10.88), income <$20,000 (ORadj , 2.62; 95% CI, 1.93-3.57), being divorced/separated or widowed (ORadj , 1.36; 95% CI, 1.03-1.79), and limb amputation (ORadj , 1.52; 95% CI, 1.03-2.24). Risk factors for the insufficiently active cluster included chronic health conditions, psychological distress, low education or income, being obese or overweight, female sex, nonwhite race/ethnicity, single marital status, cranial radiation, and cisplatin exposure. CONCLUSIONS: RHBs co-occur in survivors of childhood cancer and their siblings. Economic and educational disadvantages and psychological distress should be considered in screening and interventions to reduce RHBs. Cancer 2016. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

This article summarizes cancer mortality trends and disparities based on data from the National Center for Health Statistics. It is the first in a series of articles that will describe the American Cancer Society's vision for how cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment can be transformed to lower the cancer burden in the United States, and sets the stage for a national cancer control plan, or blueprint, for the American Cancer Society goals for reducing cancer mortality by the year 2035. Although steady progress in reducing cancer mortality has been made over the past few decades, it is clear that much more could, and should, be done to save lives through the comprehensive application of currently available evidence-based public health and clinical interventions to all segments of the population.

BACKGROUND: This study assessed the use of active surveillance in men with low-risk prostate cancer and evaluated institutional factors associated with the receipt of active surveillance. METHODS: A retrospective, hospital-based cohort of 115,208 men with low-risk prostate cancer diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 was used. Multivariate and mixed effects models were used to examine variation and factors associated with active surveillance. RESULTS: During the study period, the use of active surveillance increased from 6.8% in 2010 to 19.9% in 2014 (estimated annual percentage change, +28.8%; 95% confidence interval [CI], + 19.6% to + 38.7%; P = .002). The adjusted probability of active-surveillance receipt by institution was highly variable. Compared with patients treated at comprehensive community cancer centers, patients treated at community cancer programs (odds ratio [OR], 2.00; 95% CI, 1.50-2.67; P < .001) and academic institutions (OR, 2.47; 95%, CI, 1.81-3.37; P < .001) had higher odds of receiving active surveillance. Compared with patients treated at very low-volume facilities, patients treated at very high-volume facilities had higher odds of receiving active surveillance (OR, 3.57; 95% CI, 1.94-6.55; P < .001). Patient and hospital characteristics accounted for 60.2% of the overall variation, whereas the treating institution accounted for 91.5% of the unexplained variability. CONCLUSIONS: Within this hospital-based cohort, the use of active surveillance for low-risk prostate cancer increased significantly over time. Significant variation was found in the use of active surveillance. Most of the variation was attributable to facility-related factors such as the facility type, facility volume, and institution. Policies to achieve consistent and higher rates of active surveillance, when appropriate, should be a priority of professional societies and patient advocacy groups. Cancer 2018;124:55-64.

BACKGROUND: Patient safety is a critical concern in clinical oncology, but the ability to measure adverse events (AEs) across cancer care is limited by a narrow focus on treatment-related toxicities. The objective of this study was to assess the nature and extent of AEs among cancer patients across inpatient and outpatient settings. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of 400 adult patients selected by stratified random sampling who had breast (n = 128), colorectal (n = 136), or lung cancer (n = 136) treated at a comprehensive cancer center in 2012. Candidate AEs, or injuries due to medical care, were identified by trained nurse reviewers over the course of 1 year from medical records and safety-reporting databases. Physicians determined the AE harm severity and the likelihood of preventability and harm mitigation. RESULTS: The 400-patient sample represented 133,358 days of follow-up. Three hundred four AEs were identified for an overall rate of 2.3 events per 1000 patient days (91.2 per 1000 inpatient days and 0.9 per 1000 outpatient days). Thirty-four percent of the patients had 1 or more AEs (95% confidence interval, 29%-39%), and 16% of the patients had 1 or more preventable or mitigable AEs (95% confidence interval, 13%-20%). The AE rate for patients with breast cancer was lower than the rate for patients with colorectal or lung cancer (P </= .001). The preventable or mitigable AE rate was 0.9 per 1000 patient days. Six percent of AEs and 4% of preventable AEs resulted in serious harm. Examples included lymphedema, abscess, and renal failure. CONCLUSIONS: A heavy burden of AEs, including preventable or mitigable events, has been identified. Future research should examine risk factors and improvement strategies for reducing their burden.

This review is an abbreviated version of a report prepared for the American Cancer Society Global Health department and EMD Serono, Inc., a subsidiary of Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, which was released at the Union for International Cancer Control World Cancer Congress in Paris in November 2016. The original report can be found at https://www.cancer.org/health-care-professionals/our-global-health-work/global-ca ncer-burden/global-burden-of-cancer-in-women.html. Staff in the Intramural Research Department of the American Cancer Society designed and conducted the study, including analysis, interpretation, and presentation of the review. The funding sources had no involvement in the study design, data analysis and interpretation, or preparation of the reviewThere are striking disparities in the global cancer burden in women, yet few publications highlight cancer occurrence in this population, particularly for cancers that are not sex specific. This article, the first in a series of two, summarizes the current burden, trends, risk factors, prevention, early detection, and survivorship of all cancers combined and seven sites (breast, cervix, uterine corpus, ovary, colorectum, lung, and liver) that account for about 60% of the cancer burden among women worldwide, using data from the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Estimated 2012 overall cancer death rates in general are higher among women in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) than high-income countries (HICs), despite their lower overall incidence rates, largely due to inadequate access to early detection and treatment. For example, the top mortality rates are in Zimbabwe (147 deaths per 100,000) and Malawi (138). Furthermore, incidence rates of cancers associated with economic development (e.g., lung, breast, colorectum) are rising in several LMICs. The burden of cancer among women could be substantially reduced in both HICs and LMICs through broad and equitable implementation of effective interventions, including tobacco control, HPV and HBV vaccination, and screening (breast, cervix, and colorectum).

Suppressor of cancer cell invasion (SCAI) has been originally characterized as a tumor suppressor inhibiting metastasis in different human cancer cells, and it has been suggested that SCAI expression declines in tumors. The expression patterns and role of SCAI during physiological and pathophysiological processes is still poorly understood. Earlier we demonstrated that SCAI is regulating the epithelial-mesenchymal transition of proximal tubular epithelial cells, it is downregulated during renal fibrosis and it is overexpressed in Wilms' tumors. Here we bring further evidence for the involvement of SCAI during cell plasticity and we examine the prognostic value and expression patterns of SCAI in various tumors. SCAI prevented the activation of the SMA promoter induced by angiotensin II. SCAI expression decreased in a model of endothelial-mesenchymal transition and increased during iPS reprogramming of fibroblasts. During renal fibrosis SCAI expression declined, as evidenced in a rat model of renal transplant rejection and in TGF-beta1 overexpressing transgenic mice. High expression of SCAI correlated with better survival in patients with breast and lung cancers. Intriguingly, in the case of other cancers (gastric, prostate, colorectal) high SCAI expression correlated with poor survival of patients. Finally, we bring evidence for SCAI overexpression in colorectal cancer patients, irrespective of stage or metastatic status of the disease, suggesting a diverse role of SCAI in various diseases and cancer.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to describe perceptions and associated risk factors of the impact of cancer on functional outcomes, including social relationships, exercise, finances, and religion, among adult survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: Evaluable participants included 3001 adult survivors (mean age, 32.5 years; range, 18.3-63.8 years; 24.1 years from diagnosis; 50.8% male; 84.9% Caucasian) who were enrolled in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort study. Perceptions of the impact of cancer were assessed using the Brief Cancer Impact Assessment (BCIA). Regression models were used to evaluate risk factors for functional outcomes. RESULTS: The median response on the BCIA was a perception that cancer had minimal impact on the domains assessed. Approximately 33.1% to 46.6% of survivors indicated this response across the 4 subscales, although responses ranged from very positive to very negative impact. Other than diagnosis (with survivors of brain tumors generally indicating a more negative impact of cancer, with subscale estimates of -1.25 for caregiving and finance and -1.01 for social and emotional and an odds ratio of 1.83 for exercise and diet), most variability was because of demographic factors, including sex, age, race, education, and employment. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings highlight that many long-term adult survivors perceive minimal impact of childhood cancer on functional aspects of adulthood, including caregiving, finances, exercise, social-emotional relationships, and religion. This suggests that survivors may not be focusing on the influence of likely physical and psychological late effects of their disease in their day-to-day lives. For those who do perceive a negative impact, variability in responses suggests that there are of survivors who may benefit from interventions focused on the achievement of functional goals.

BACKGROUND: It has been observed that married cancer patients have lower mortality rates than unmarried patients, but data for different racial/ethnic groups are scarce. The authors examined the risk of overall mortality associated with marital status across racial/ethnic groups and sex in data from the California Cancer Registry. METHODS: California Cancer Registry data for all first primary invasive cancers diagnosed from 2000 through 2009 for the 10 most common sites of cancer-related death for non-Hispanic whites (NHWs), blacks, Asians/Pacific Islanders (APIs), and Hispanics were used to estimate multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for marital status in relation to overall mortality by race/ethnicity and sex. The study cohort included 393,470 male and 389,697 female cancer patients and 204,007 and 182,600 deaths from all causes, respectively, through December 31, 2012. RESULTS: All-cause mortality was higher in unmarried patients than in married patients, but there was significant variation by race/ethnicity. Adjusted HRs (95% CIs) ranged from 1.24 (95% CI, 1.23-1.26) in NHWs to 1.11 (95% CI, 1.07-1.15) in APIs among males and from 1.17 (95% CI, 1.15-1.18) in NHWs to 1.07 (95% CI, 1.04-1.11) in APIs among females. All-cause mortality associated with unmarried status compared with married status was higher in US-born API and Hispanic men and women relative to their foreign-born counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: For patients who have the cancers that contribute most to mortality, being unmarried is associated with worse overall survival compared with being married, with up to 24% higher mortality among NHW males but only 6% higher mortality among foreign-born Hispanic and API females. Future research should pursue the identification of factors underlying these associations to inform targeted interventions for unmarried cancer patients. Cancer 2016;122:1570-8.

BACKGROUND: Although married cancer patients have more favorable survival than unmarried patients, reasons underlying this association are not fully understood. The authors evaluated the role of economic resources, including health insurance status and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES), in a large California cohort. METHODS: From the California Cancer Registry, we identified 783,167 cancer patients (386,607 deaths) who were diagnosed during 2000 through 2009 with a first primary, invasive cancer of the 10 most common sites of cancer-related death for each sex and were followed through 2012. Age-stratified and stage-stratified Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality associated with marital status, adjusted for cancer site, race/ethnicity, and treatment. RESULTS: Compared with married patients, unmarried patients had an elevated risk of mortality that was higher among males (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.26-1.29) than among females (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.18-1.20; Pinteraction < .001). Adjustment for insurance status and nSES reduced the marital status HRs to 1.22 for males and 1.15 for females. There was some evidence of synergistic effects of marital status, insurance, and nSES, with relatively higher risks observed for unmarried status among those who were under-insured and living in high nSES areas compared with those who were under-insured and living in low nSES areas (Pinteraction = 6.8 x 10(-9) among males and 8.2 x 10(-8) among females). CONCLUSIONS: The worse survival of unmarried than married cancer patients appears to be minimally explained by differences in economic resources. Cancer 2016;122:1618-25.

Cumulative relative survival curves for many cancers reach a plateau several years after diagnosis, indicating that the cancer survivor group has reached "statistical" cure. Parametric mixture cure model analysis on grouped relative survival curves provide an interesting way to determine the proportion of statistically cured cases and the mean survival time of the fatal cases in particular for population-based cancer registries. Based on the relative survival data from the Belgian Cancer Registry, parametric cure models were applied to seven cancer sites (cervix, colon, corpus uteri, skin melanoma, pancreas, stomach and oesophagus), at the Flemish Regional level for the incidence period 1999-2011. Statistical cure was observed for the examined cancer sites except for oesophageal cancer. The estimated cured proportion ranged from 5.9% [5.7, 6.1] for pancreatic cancer to 80.8% [80.5, 81.2] for skin melanoma. Cure results were further stratified by gender or age group. Stratified cured proportions were higher for females compared to males in colon cancer, stomach cancer, pancreas cancer and skin melanoma, which can mainly be attributed to differences in stage and age distribution between both sexes. This study demonstrates the applicability of cure rate models for the selected cancer sites after 14 years of follow-up and presents the first population-based results on the cure of cancer in Belgium.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a well-established prognostic marker for oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (OPSCC). Because of the limited numbers of women and nonwhites in studies to date, sex and racial/ethnic differences in prognosis have not been well explored. In this study, survival differences were explored by the tumor HPV status among 1) patients with OPSCCs by sex and race and 2) patients with nonoropharyngeal (non-OP) head and neck squamous cell cancers (HNSCCs). METHODS: This retrospective, multi-institution study included OPSCCs and non-OP HNSCCs of the oral cavity, larynx, and nasopharynx diagnosed from 1995 to 2012. Race/ethnicity was categorized as white non-Hispanic, black non-Hispanic, Asian non-Hispanic, and Hispanic of any race. Tumors were centrally tested for p16 overexpression and the presence of HPV by HPV16 DNA and high-risk HPV E6/E7 messenger RNA in situ hybridization. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate overall survival (OS). RESULTS: The study population included 239 patients with OPSCC and 621 patients with non-OP HNSCC with a median follow-up time of 3.5 years. After adjustments for the tumor HPV status, age, current tobacco use, and stage, the risk of death was lower for women versus men with OPSCC (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.55; P = .04). The results were similar with p16. In contrast, for non-OP HNSCCs, HPV positivity, p16 positivity, and sex were not associated with OS. CONCLUSIONS: For OPSCC, there are differences in survival by sex, even after the tumor HPV status has been taken into account. For non-OP HNSCC, the HPV status and the p16 status are not of prognostic significance. Cancer 2017;123:1566-1575. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

By the middle of this century, racial/ethnic minority populations will collectively constitute 50% of the US population. This temporal shift in the racial/ethnic composition of the US population demands a close look at the race/ethnicity-specific burden of morbidity and premature mortality among survivors of childhood cancer. To optimize targeted long-term follow-up care, it is essential to understand whether the burden of morbidity borne by survivors of childhood cancer differs by race/ethnicity. This is challenging because the number of minority participants is often limited in current childhood cancer survivorship research, resulting in a paucity of race/ethnicity-specific recommendations and/or interventions. Although the overall childhood cancer incidence increased between 1973 and 2003, the mortality rate declined; however, these changes did not differ appreciably by race/ethnicity. The authors speculated that any racial/ethnic differences in outcome are likely to be multifactorial, and drew on data from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study to illustrate the various contributors (socioeconomic characteristics, health behaviors, and comorbidities) that could explain any observed differences in key treatment-related complications. Finally, the authors outlined challenges in conducting race/ethnicity-specific childhood cancer survivorship research, demonstrating that there are limited absolute numbers of children who are diagnosed and survive cancer in any one racial/ethnic minority population, thereby precluding a rigorous evaluation of adverse events among specific primary cancer diagnoses and treatment exposure groups.

BACKGROUND: Results from the second CONCORD study (CONCORD-2) indicated that 5-year net survival for lung cancer was low (range, 10%-20%) between 1995 and 2009 in most countries, including the United States, which was at the higher end of this range. METHODS: Data from CONCORD-2 were used to analyze net survival among patients with lung cancer (aged 15-99 years) who were diagnosed in 37 states covering 80% of the US population. Survival was corrected for background mortality using state-specific and race-specific life tables and age-standardized using International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Net survival was estimated for patients diagnosed between 2001 and 2003 and between 2004 and 2009 at 1, 3, and 5 years after diagnosis by race (all races, black, and white); Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Summary Stage 2000; and US state. RESULTS: Five-year net survival increased from 16.4% (95% confidence interval, 16.3%-16.5%) for patients diagnosed 2001-2003 to 19.0% (18.8%-19.1%) for those diagnosed 2004-2009, with increases in most states and among both blacks and whites. Between 2004 and 2009, 5-year survival was lower among blacks (14.9%) than among whites (19.4%) and ranged by state from 14.5% to 25.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Lung cancer survival improved slightly between the periods 2001-2003 and 2004-2009 but was still low, with variation between states, and persistently lower survival among blacks than whites. Efforts to control well established risk factors would be expected to have the greatest impact on reducing the burden of lung cancer, and efforts to ensure that all patients receive timely and appropriate treatment should reduce the differences in survival by race and state.

Over the past 30 years there has been an increase in the survival of cancer patients resulting from the advances in cancer management and improved detection of cancer in its early stages. The aim of the study was to analyze the frequency of multiple malignancies in a sample of hospitalized patients in Poland. We analyzed retrospectively the records of 1112 cancer patients hospitalized in the period of January 2013 - August 2014. The criterion for inclusion into the group of multiple malignancy patients was the presence of at least two different malignancies. We found 52 cases in which lung cancer accompanied different malignancies and 4 cases where the multiple malignancy was not associated with the respiratory system. Lung cancer was chronologically the first malignancy unravelled in 11 patients, the second in 39, and the third in 2. Other malignancies chronologically being the first to be unravelled in patients included the following: colorectal cancer in 8 patients, prostatic cancer in 6, renal cell carcinoma 4, and the subsequent: prostate cancer 4, bladder cancer 3, hematopoietic malignancies 3, and breast cancer 2. We conclude that patients with multiple malignancy account for 5.0 % of lung cancer patients. Lung cancer is more frequent as a second malignancy developing in patients with multiple malignancy. Synchronous cancers become apparent at older age than metachronous cancers.

BACKGROUND: A nocebo is an inert substance associated with adverse events. Although previous studies have examined the positive (placebo) effects of such inert substances, few have examined negative (nocebo) adverse event profiles, particularly in older patients who have higher morbidity and can experience frequent and severe adverse events from cancer therapy. METHODS: This study focused on placebo/nocebo-exposed patients who participated in 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled, cancer therapeutic studies, namely, North Central Cancer Therapy Group trial NCCTG 97-24-51 and American College of Surgeons Oncology Group trial Z9001, with the goal of reporting the comparative, age-based adverse event rates, as reported during the conduct of these trials. RESULTS: Among the 446 patients who received only placebo/nocebo and who were the focus of the current report, 161 were aged >/=65 years at the time of respective trial entry, and 5234 adverse events occurred. Unadjusted adverse event rates did not differ significantly between patients aged >/=65 years and younger patients (rate ratio, 1.01; 99% confidence interval, 0.47-2.02), and the findings were similar findings for grade 2 or worse adverse events and for all symptom-driven adverse events (for example, pain, loss of appetite, anxiety). Adjustment for sex, ethnicity, baseline performance score, and individual trial resulted in no significant age-based differences in adverse event rates. Similar findings were observed with an age threshold of 70 years. CONCLUSIONS: Adverse events are equally common in older and younger cancer patients who are exposed to nocebo and thus require the same degree of clinical consideration regardless of age.

INTRODUCTION: The signalling function of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in endocannabinoid system is delineated by Monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). MAGL readdresses the lipid stores in the direction of pro-tumorigenic signalling lipids in cancer cells. Selective as well as potent MAGL inhibitors are limited in number hence their continuous development may lead to a breakthrough invention in the field of MAGL inhibitors. In succession of the above, we have synthesised 2-amino-4- methylthiazole-5-carboxylate derivatives and characterised them by collective use of IR, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, Mass spectral data and elemental analysis. METHODOLOGY: Thirteen compounds (3c-g, 4c, 4e, 4f and 6b-f) inhibited MAGL with IC50 value 0.037- 9.60 microM. Two compounds (3g and 4c) were found to be most potent with IC50 values 0.037 and 0.063microM, respectively. Thirty synthesised compounds were sent to NCI for anticancer screening, out of which nine compounds were selected for one dose anticancer assay. Compounds 3g (NSC:788170) and 4c (NSC:788176)were found to be the most potent during one dose anticancer screening and fulfilled the specified threshold for growth inhibition criteria of NCI and were further selected for full panel five dose assay at 10-fold dilutions of five different concentrations. CONCLUSION: Compound 3g displayed GI50 value 0.865 muM against EKVX (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer cell line), and 1.20 microM against MDA-MB-468 (Breast Cancer cell Line), while (4c) showed GI50 value 0.34 and 0.96 microM against HOP-92 and EKVX (Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer cell line) and 1.08 microM against MDA-MB-231/ATCC(Breast Cancer cell Line). In addition, molecular docking studies of the said MAGL inhibitors have also been presented in this article.

BACKGROUND: Although there is a general perception that, as the older population grows in number, more are undergoing surgery, there are few data on trends in major resections for cancer and short-term outcomes in this group. METHODS: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was (NIS) used to estimate the national trends of major upper abdominal resections (esophagus, stomach, liver, pancreas) for cancer in octogenarians (aged >/=80 years) from 2001 to 2011. Resection rates performed per year were incidence-adjusted within this age group for each cancer type as determined by the NIS database. Joinpoint regression was used to calculate average annual percentage changes (AAPC) when evaluating trends over time. RESULTS: During the study period, octogenarians underwent an estimated 30,356 upper abdominal organ resections for cancer in the United States, representing 3.8% of all cancer admissions among octogenarians. Resection rates in octogenarians increased significantly over time (AAPC, 2.54; P < .001) secondary to increasing trends in pancreatic (AAPC, 11.52; P < .001) and hepatic (AAPC, 6.67; P < .001) resections. Elixhauser comorbidity index scores increased from a mean of 3.61 to 4.20 (AAPC, 1.31; P < .001), whereas inpatient mortality during this time decreased from 13.6% to 8.2% (AAPC, 5.58; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Overall rates of major upper abdominal cancer resections in octogenarians are increasing over time, driven by increases in liver and pancreatic resections. These increases were observed despite a less favorable patient morbidity profile over time. These patterns may suggest shifting selection criteria for octogenarians undergoing major abdominal surgery over time in the context of diminishing postoperative mortality. Cancer 2018;124:125-35.

BACKGROUND: Patients with a terminal illness should have access to their chosen location of death. Cancer is the leading cause of non-accidental death among adolescents and young adults (AYAs; those aged 15-39 years). Although surveys have suggested that a majority of these patients prefer a home death, to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding their barriers to accessing their preferred location of death. As a first step, the authors sought to determine, across a large population, 20-year trends in the location of death among AYA patients with cancer. METHODS: Using the Vital Statistics Death Certificate Database of the California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, the authors performed a retrospective, population-based analysis of California patients with cancer aged 15 to 39 years who died between 1989 and 2011. Sociodemographic and clinical factors associated with hospital death were examined using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 30,573 AYA oncology decedents, 57% died in a hospital, 33% died at home, and 10% died in other locations (eg, hospice facility or nursing facility). Between 1989 and 1994, hospital death rates decreased from 68.3% to 53.6% and at-home death rates increased from 16.8% to 35.5%. Between 1995 and 2011, these rates were stable. Those individuals who were more likely to die in a hospital were those aged <30 years, of minority race, of Hispanic ethnicity, who lived </=10 miles from a specialty center, and who had a diagnosis of leukemia or lymphoma. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the majority of AYA cancer deaths occurred in a hospital, with a 5-year shift to more in-home deaths that abated after 1995. In-hospital deaths were more common among younger patients, patients of minority race/ethnicities, and those with a leukemia or lymphoma diagnosis. Further study is needed to determine whether these rates and disparities are consistent with patient preferences. Cancer 2017;123:4178-4184. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-related financial burden has been linked to cancer survivors (CS) forgoing/delaying medical care, skipping follow-up visits, and discontinuing medications. To the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the effect of financial burden on the health-related quality of life of CS. METHODS: The authors analyzed 2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data. Financial burden was present if one of the following problems was reported: borrowed money/declared bankruptcy, worried about paying large medical bills, unable to cover the cost of medical care visits, or other financial sacrifices. The following outcomes were evaluated: Physical Component Score (PCS) and Mental Component Score (MCS) of the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12), depressed mood, psychological distress, and worry related to cancer recurrence. The authors also assessed the effect of the number of financial problems on these outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 19.6 million CS analyzed, 28.7% reported financial burden. Among them, the average PCS (42.3 vs 44.9) and MCS (48.1 vs 52.1) were lower for those with financial burden versus those without. In adjusted analyses, CS with financial burden had significantly lower PCS (beta = -2.45), and MCS (beta = -3.05), had increased odds of depressed mood (odds ratio, 1.95), and were more likely to worry about cancer recurrence (odds ratio, 3.54). Survivors reporting >/= 3 financial problems reported statistically significant and clinically meaningful differences (>/=3 points) in the mean PCS and MCS compared with survivors without financial problems. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer-related financial burden was associated with lower health-related quality of life, increased risk of depressed mood, and a higher frequency of worrying about cancer recurrence among CS.

We reviewed available evidence on coffee drinking and the risk of all cancers and selected cancers updated to May 2016. Coffee consumption is not associated with overall cancer risk. A meta-analysis reported a pooled relative risk (RR) for an increment of 1 cup of coffee/day of 1.00 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.99-1.01] for all cancers. Coffee drinking is associated with a reduced risk of liver cancer. A meta-analysis of cohort studies found an RR for an increment of consumption of 1 cup/day of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81-0.90) for liver cancer and a favorable effect on liver enzymes and cirrhosis. Another meta-analysis showed an inverse relation for endometrial cancer risk, with an RR of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.88-0.96) for an increment of 1 cup/day. A possible decreased risk was found in some studies for oral/pharyngeal cancer and for advanced prostate cancer. Although data are mixed, overall, there seems to be some favorable effect of coffee drinking on colorectal cancer in case-control studies, in the absence of a consistent relation in cohort studies. For bladder cancer, the results are not consistent; however, any possible direct association is not dose and duration related, and might depend on a residual confounding effect of smoking. A few studies suggest an increased risk of childhood leukemia after maternal coffee drinking during pregnancy, but data are limited and inconsistent. Although the results of studies are mixed, the overall evidence suggests no association of coffee intake with cancers of the stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, ovary, and prostate overall. Data are limited, with RR close to unity for other neoplasms, including those of the esophagus, small intestine, gallbladder and biliary tract, skin, kidney, brain, thyroid, as well as for soft tissue sarcoma and lymphohematopoietic cancer.

OBJECTIVE: We evaluated patients with history of previous malignancy to determine risk of an ensuing bladder cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 9 registry database from 1973 to 1999 (SEER) was reviewed for patients with initial primary cancers in oral cavity and pharynx, colon and rectum, respiratory system, breast, prostate, testis, or penis. This group of patients was then examined to identify subsequent separate primary malignancies in the bladder. Comparison was made to the incidence of bladder cancer in the general population to determine a standardized incidence ratio (SIR). Additional analysis was performed based on age at diagnosis, stage, gender, race, and use of external beam radiation for treatment of initial cancer. RESULTS: A total of 7,289 (0.5%) of patients had a bladder cancer following their initial malignancy. Patients with prostate cancer had the largest increase in risk of bladder cancer with a SIR of 8.24, and all initial cancer groups had an elevated risk of bladder cancer relative to the general population. External beam radiation and non-White gender were associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Older age at diagnosis of the initial cancer correlated with a lower risk of subsequent bladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests an increased risk of bladder cancer following a separate initial cancer. Lower threshold for working up those patients for bladder cancer may be warranted.

BACKGROUND: Parents of children with cancer desire information regarding the late effects of treatment. In the current study, the authors assessed parents' preparedness for late effects at least 5 years after their child's diagnosis. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted of all eligible parents of children with cancer between April 2004 and September 2005 at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center within 1 year of diagnosis, and a follow-up questionnaire was administered at least 5 years later. RESULTS: Approximately 66% of parents of children who were still living, and who were able to be contacted, completed the follow-up questionnaire (91 of 138 parents). Approximately 77% of respondents (70 of 91 respondents) were parents of disease-free survivors and 23% (21 of 91 respondents) were parents of children with recurrent disease. The majority of parents believed they were well prepared for their child's oncology treatment (87%), but fewer felt prepared for future limitations experienced by their children (70%; P = .003 using the McNemar test) or for life after cancer (62%; P<.001). On bivariable analysis among parents of disease-free survivors, parents were more likely to believe themselves to be prepared for future limitations when they also reported that communication with the oncologist helped to address worries regarding the future (odds ratio, 4.50; P = .01). At the time of diagnosis, both parents and physicians underestimated a child's risk of future limitations; 45% of parents and 39% of clinicians predicted future limitations in physical abilities, intelligence, or quality of life, but at the time of the follow-up questionnaire >5 years later, 72% of children experienced limitations in at least 1 domain. CONCLUSIONS: Parents believe themselves to be less prepared for survivorship than for treatment. High-quality communication may help parents to feel more prepared for life after cancer therapy.

BACKGROUND: Long-term survivors of pediatric cancer are at risk of life-threatening late effects of their cancer. Previous studies have shown excesses in long-term mortality within high-risk groups defined by demographic and treatment characteristics. METHODS: To investigate conditional survival in a pediatric cancer population, the authors performed an analysis of conditional survival in the original Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohort and the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database registry. The overall probability of death for patients at 5 years and 10 years after they survived 5, 10, 15, and 20 years since cancer diagnosis and cause-specific death in 10 years for 5-year survivors were estimated using the cumulative incidence method. RESULTS: Among patients in the CCSS and SEER cohorts who were alive 5 years after their cancer diagnosis, within each diagnosis group at least 92% were alive in the subsequent 5 years, except for patients with leukemia, of whom only 88% of 5-year survivors remained alive in the subsequent 5 years. The probability of all-cause mortality in the next 10 years among patients who survived at least 5 years after diagnosis was 8.8% in CCSS and 10.6% in SEER, approximately 75% of which was due to neoplasms as the cause of death. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of death among survivors of pediatric cancer in 10 years can vary between diagnosis groups by at most 12%, even up to 20 years after diagnosis. This information is clinically significant when counseling patients regarding their conditional survival, particularly when survivors are seen in long-term follow-up.

BACKGROUND: Demoralization refers to a state in which there is a perceived inability to cope, that is associated with a sense of disheartenment and a loss of hope and meaning. This study investigated the co-occurrence versus independence of demoralization with mental disorders and suicidal ideation to evaluate its features as a concept of distress in the context of severe illness. METHODS: In a cross-sectional sample of 430 mixed cancer patients, we assessed demoralization with the Demoralization Scale (DS); the 4-week prevalence of mood, anxiety, and adjustment disorders and suicidal ideation with the standardized Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Oncology (CIDI-O); and depressive symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). We compared the relative risk (RR) for mental disorders associated with demoralization to that associated with self-reported depression. RESULTS: Clinically relevant levels of demoralization were present in 21% of the patients. Demoralization co-occurred with a mood/anxiety disorder in 7%; 14% were demoralized in absence of any mood/anxiety disorder. Demoralization and adjustment disorders co-occurred in 2%. The RR for any mood/anxiety disorder was 4.0 in patients with demoralization (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.5-6.2) and 3.0 in those with depression (95% CI, 1.9-4.6). Demoralization, but not depression, was associated with a significantly increased risk for suicidal ideation after controlling for mental disorders (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Clinically relevant demoralization frequently occurs independently of a mental disorder in patients with cancer and has a unique contribution to suicidal ideation. Demoralization is a useful concept to identify profiles of psychological distress symptoms amenable to interventions improving psychological well-being in this population. Cancer 2017;123:3394-401.

BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors were at risk of development of second malignant neoplasms. The aim of this study is to evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of second malignant neoplasms in childhood cancer survivors in a tertiary paediatric oncology centre in Hong Kong, China. METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of patients with childhood cancer treated in Children's Cancer Centre in Prince of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong, China between May 1984 and June 2009. Case records of patients who developed second malignant neoplasms were reviewed. RESULTS: Totally 1374 new cases aged less than 21-year old were treated in our centre in this 25-year study period. Twelve cases developed second malignant neoplasms with 10-year and 20-year cumulative incidence of 1.3% (95% confidence interval 0.3% - 2.3%) and 2.9% (95% confidence interval 1.1% - 4.7%) respectively. Another 4 cases were referred to us from other centres for the management of second malignant neoplasms. In this cohort of 16 children with second malignant neoplasms, the most frequent second malignant neoplasms were acute leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 6) and central nervous system tumor (n = 4). Median interval between diagnosis of primary and second malignant neoplasms was 7.4 years (range 2.1 - 13.3 years). Eight patients developed second solid tumor within the previous irradiated field. Radiotherapy significantly increased the risk of development of second solid tumor in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (P = 0.027). Seven out of 16 patients who developed second malignant neoplasms had a family history of cancer among the first or second-degree relatives. Nine patients died of progression of second malignant neoplasms, mainly resulted from second central nervous system tumor and osteosarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: Cumulative incidence of second cancer in our centre was comparable to western countries. Radiotherapy was associated with second solid tumour among patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients who developed second brain tumor and osteosarcoma had a poor outcome.

BACKGROUND: Female cancer patients who are exposed to gonadotoxic chemotherapy are at risk of future infertility. Research suggests that disparities in fertility preservation counseling (FPC) may exist. Previous research is limited by recall bias; therefore, this study examined objective electronic medical chart data regarding FPC at an academic medical center. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included reproductive-aged women (18-45 years old) with a diagnosis of breast, gynecological, or hematological cancer and who were exposed to a gonadotoxic chemotherapeutic agent from 2009 to 2013. Chi-square and logistic regression analyses were utilized to analyze disparities in FPC. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-nine women met the study criteria. One hundred eighty-one women were diagnosed with breast cancer, 52 with hematological cancer, and 26 with gynecological cancer. 160/259 (62%) women had documented counseling for fertility preservation (FP), 60 (23%) women were not counseled as counseling was determined to be "not applicable," 16 (6%) women were not counseled and no explanation was given for the lack of counseling, and counseling was not documented in 23 (9%) charts. Age, marital status, and racial/ethnic background were related to counseling status. Patients with gynecological or hematological cancer were more likely to be counseled than other patients. Logistic regression results demonstrated that FPC was largely driven by cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Although cancer diagnosis was the greatest predictor of FPC, disparities were evident in the counseling of female cancer patients for FP treatment. Equality in counseling female patients for FP treatment is imperative to reduce the risk of emotional harm and future infertility.

PURPOSE: Outcomes for early-stage breast cancer have improved. First-generation adjuvant chemotherapy trials reported a 0.27% 8-year cumulative incidence of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myelogenous leukemia. Incomplete ascertainment and follow-up may have underestimated subsequent risk of treatment-associated marrow neoplasm (MN). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined the MN frequency in 20,063 patients with stage I to III breast cancer treated at US academic centers between 1998 and 2007. Time-to-event analyses were censored at first date of new cancer event, last contact date, or death and considered competing risks. Cumulative incidence, hazard ratios (HRs), and comparisons with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results estimates were obtained. Marrow cytogenetics data were reviewed. RESULTS: Fifty patients developed MN (myeloid, n = 42; lymphoid, n = 8) after breast cancer (median follow-up, 5.1 years). Patients who developed MN had similar breast cancer stage distribution, race, and chemotherapy exposure but were older compared with patients who did not develop MN (median age, 59.1 v 53.9 years, respectively; P = .03). Two thirds of patients had complex MN cytogenetics. Risk of MN was significantly increased after surgery plus chemotherapy (HR, 6.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 36.1) or after all modalities (surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation; HR, 7.6; 95% CI, 1.6 to 35.8), compared with no treatment with chemotherapy. MN rates per 1,000 person-years were 0.16 (surgery), 0.43 (plus radiation), 0.46 (plus chemotherapy), and 0.54 (all three modalities). Cumulative incidence of MN doubled between years 5 and 10 (0.24% to 0.48%); 9% of patients were alive at 10 years. CONCLUSION: In this large early-stage breast cancer cohort, MN risk after radiation and/or adjuvant chemotherapy was low but higher than previously described. Risk continued to increase beyond 5 years. Individual risk of MN must be balanced against the absolute survival benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy.

Childhood cancer survivors are at risk for development of subsequent neoplasms of the CNS. Better understanding of the rates, risk factors, and outcomes of subsequent neoplasms of the CNS among survivors of childhood cancer could lead to more informed screening guidelines. Two investigators independently did a systematic search of Medline and Embase (from January, 1966, through March, 2012) for studies examining subsequent neoplasms of the CNS among survivors of childhood cancer. Articles were selected to answer three questions: what is the risk of CNS tumours after radiation to the cranium for a paediatric cancer, compared with the risk in the general population; what are the outcomes in children with subsequent neoplasms of the CNS who received CNS-directed radiation for a paediatric cancer; and, are outcomes of subsequent neoplasms different from primary neoplasms of the same histology? Our search identified 72 reports, of which 18 were included in this Review. These studies reported that childhood cancer survivors have an 8.1-52.3-times higher incidence of subsequent CNS neoplasms compared with the general population. Nearly all cancer survivors who developed a CNS neoplasm had been exposed to cranial radiation, and some studies showed a correlation between radiation dose and risk of subsequent CNS tumours. 5-year survival ranged from 0-19.5% for subsequent high-grade gliomas and 57.3-100% for meningiomas, which are similar rates to those observed in patients with primary gliomas or meningiomas. The quality of evidence was limited by variation in study design, heterogeneity of details regarding treatment and outcomes, limited follow-up, and small sample sizes. We conclude that survivors of childhood cancer who received cranial radiation therapy have an increased risk for subsequent CNS neoplasms. The current literature is insufficient to comment about the potential harms and benefits of routine screening for subsequent CNS neoplasms.

BACKGROUND: This study explored differences in sexual activity, function, and concerns between cancer survivors and cancer-free controls in a population-based study. METHODS: The data were from 2982 men and 3708 women who were 50 years old or older and were participating in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Sexual well-being was assessed with the Sexual Relationships and Activities Questionnaire, and cancer diagnoses were self-reported. RESULTS: There were no differences between cancer survivors and controls in levels of sexual activity (76.0% vs 78.5% for men and 58.2% vs 55.5% for women) or sexual function. Men and women with cancer diagnoses were more dissatisfied with their sex lives than controls (age-adjusted percentages: 30.9% vs 19.8% for men [P = .023] and 18.2% vs 11.8% for women [P = .034]), and women with cancer were more concerned about levels of sexual desire (10.2% vs 7.1%; P = .006). Women diagnosed < 5 years ago were more likely to report difficulty with becoming aroused (55.4% vs 31.8%; P = .016) and achieving orgasm (60.6% vs 28.3%; P < .001) and were more concerned about sexual desire (14.8% vs 7.1%; P = .007) and orgasmic experience (17.6% vs 7.1%; P = .042) than controls, but there were no differences in men. CONCLUSIONS: Self-reports of sexual activity and functioning in older people with cancer are broadly comparable to age-matched, cancer-free controls. There is a need to identify the causes of sexual dissatisfaction among long-term cancer survivors despite apparently normal levels of sexual activity and function for their age. The development of interventions addressing low sexual desire and problems with sexual functioning in women is also important and may be particularly relevant for cancer survivors after treatment.

The treatment of oncological patients must be based upon multidisciplinary approach, and takes place in specialized oncological centers. By the end of a specific oncological treatment further follow-up is being managed mostly by the oncologists, but the role of the general practitioners becomes more important every day and therefore should be precisely defined. Nowadays, most of the existing follow-up guidelines are not based on prospective studies, but on the experts opinion of individual oncological centers or specialists. The aim of the Croatian Society of Medical Oncology (CSMO) with these recommendations is to standardize and rationalize the diagnostic procedures algorithm in the follow-up of oncological patients after primary treatment, in patients with neuroendocrine neoplasms, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic cancer and cancer of the bile ducts.

BACKGROUND/AIM: A considerable proportion of patients with incurable cancer experience dyspnea. This study evaluates associations between the feeling of dyspnea, as quantified by radiotherapy patients scoring their symptoms before palliative treatment with the Edmonton symptom assessment system (ESAS), and potential underlying causes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospective comparison of the incidence of different parameters that could cause a feeling of dyspnea in two groups, patients with no or minimal dyspnea (ESAS score 0-2) and those with dyspnea scores >2. RESULTS: The mean dyspnea score of all 102 patients was 2.6. Dyspnea scores >2 were present in 68% of patients with lung cancer, 50% of those with breast cancer, 39% of those with prostate cancer and 26% of those with other tumors (p=0.025). Dyspnea scores >2 were also present in 69% of patients with pleural effusion (vs. 40% in patients without pleural effusion), p=0.031. Among patients treated with palliative thoracic radiotherapy, 71% had dyspnea scores >2 (40% if other targets were irradiated), p=0.041. In 13% of patients, anemia and pulmonary comorbidity were the most likely explanation for dyspnea. In 29% the feeling of dyspnea could not be related to objective findings. CONCLUSION: In the majority of patients, the feeling of dyspnea was associated with the presence of thoracic metastases with or without pleural effusion from extrathoracic primary tumors or with a lung cancer diagnosis. A substantial proportion of patients reported dyspnea that could be related neither to cancer burden nor comorbidity.

IMPORTANCE: Rigid esophagoscopy (RE) was once an essential part of the evaluation of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) due to the high likelihood of identifying a synchronous malignant neoplasm in the esophagus. Given recent advances in imaging and endoscopic techniques and changes in the incidence of esophageal cancer, the current role for RE in HNSCC staging is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the current role of RE in evaluating patients with HNSCC, and to determine the incidence of synchronous esophageal malignant neoplasms in patients with HNSCC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this retrospective study performed at an academic tertiary care center, 582 patients were studied who had undergone RE for HNSCC staging from July 1, 2004, through October 31, 2012. To assess the incidence of synchronous esophageal malignant neoplasms, a literature review was performed, and the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data set was queried. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was the incidence of synchronous esophageal malignant neoplasms, as measured by retrospective review at our institution, SEER data set analysis, and literature review. Secondary outcome measures were RE complications and nonmalignant findings during RE. RESULTS: A total of 601 staging REs were performed in 582 patients. The mean age was 60.2 years and 454 (78.0%) were men. There were 9 complications (1.5%), including 1 esophageal perforation (0.2%). Rigid esophagoscopy was aborted in 50 cases. Of the 551 completed REs, no abnormal findings were noted in 523 patients (94.9%), and nonmalignant pathologic findings were identified in 28 patients (5.1%). No synchronous primary esophageal carcinomas were detected. The incidence of synchronous esophageal malignant neoplasms found on screening endoscopy based on literature review and on SEER data set analysis was very low and has decreased from 1980 to 2010 in North America. The incidence reported in South America and Asia was relatively high. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Rigid esophagoscopy is safe, but the utility is low for cancer staging and for detection of nonmalignant esophageal disease. Review of the literature and analysis of a large national cancer data set indicate that the incidence of synchronous esophageal malignant neoplasms in patients with HNSCC is low and has been decreasing during the past 3 decades. Thus, screening esophagoscopy should be limited to patients with HNSCC who are at high risk for synchronous esophageal malignant neoplasms.

OBJECTIVE: Secretin-stimulated pancreatic juice contains DNA shed from cells lining the pancreatic ducts. Genetic analysis of this fluid may form a test to detect pancreatic ductal neoplasia. DESIGN: We employed digital next-generation sequencing ('digital NGS') to detect low-abundance mutations in secretin-stimulated juice samples collected from the duodenum of subjects enrolled in Cancer of the Pancreas Screening studies at Johns Hopkins Hospital. For each juice sample, digital NGS necessitated 96 NGS reactions sequencing nine genes. The study population included 115 subjects (53 discovery, 62 validation) (1) with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), (2) intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN), (3) controls with non-suspicious pancreata. RESULTS: Cases with PDAC and IPMN were more likely to have mutant DNA detected in pancreatic juice than controls (both p<0.0001); mutant DNA concentrations were higher in patients with PDAC than IPMN (p=0.003) or controls (p<0.001). TP53 and/or SMAD4 mutations were commonly detected in juice samples from patients with PDAC and were not detected in controls (p<0.0001); mutant TP53/SMAD4 concentrations could distinguish PDAC from IPMN cases with 32.4% sensitivity, 100% specificity (area under the curve, AUC 0.73, p=0.0002) and controls (AUC 0.82, p<0.0001). Two of four patients who developed pancreatic cancer despite close surveillance had SMAD4/TP53 mutations from their cancer detected in juice samples collected over 1 year prior to their pancreatic cancer diagnosis when no suspicious pancreatic lesions were detected by imaging. CONCLUSIONS: The detection in pancreatic juice of mutations important for the progression of low-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia and invasive pancreatic cancer may improve the management of patients undergoing pancreatic screening and surveillance.

BACKGROUND: Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines can potentially prevent greater than 90% of cervical and anal cancers as well as a substantial proportion of vulvar, vaginal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers caused by certain HPV types. Because more than 38,000 HPV-associated cancers are diagnosed annually in the United States, current studies are needed to understand how relative survival varies for each of these cancers by certain demographic characteristics, such as race and age. METHODS: The authors examined high-quality data from 27 population-based cancer registries covering approximately 59% of the US population. The analyses were limited to invasive cancers that were diagnosed during 2001 through 2011 and followed through 2011 and met specified histologic criteria for HPV-associated cancers. Five-year relative survival was calculated from diagnosis until death for these cancers by age, race, and sex. RESULTS: The 5-year age-standardized relative survival rate was 64.2% for cervical carcinomas, 52.8% for vaginal squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), 66% for vulvar SCCs, 47.4% for penile SCCs, 65.9% for anal SCCs, 56.2% for rectal SCCs, and 51.2% for oropharyngeal SCCs. Five-year relative survival was consistently higher among white patients compared with black patients for all HPV-associated cancers across all age groups; the greatest differences by race were observed for oropharyngeal SCCs among those aged <60 years and for penile SCCs among those ages 40 to 49 years compared with other age groups. CONCLUSIONS: There are large disparities in relative survival among patients with HPV-associated cancers by sex, race, and age. HPV vaccination and improved access to screening (of cancers for which screening tests are available) and treatment, especially among groups that experience higher incidence and lower survival, may reduce disparities in survival from HPV-associated cancers.

PURPOSE: Medical apps are gaining importance rapidly. Also in the field of cancer care, apps are offered. Yet, so far little is known with respect to their quality. METHODS: In a pilot phase we developed a rating tool based on formal and content-related criteria for the assessment of cancer apps. We used this instrument on cancer apps available in the App Store (iOS) concerning breast, prostate and colorectal cancer. The results were stratified according to target group, content and advertising. RESULTS: We assessed 41 mobile cancer apps. Six apps (14.63%) scored very high, fifteen apps (36.59%) high, seventeen apps (41.46%) were deficient, and three apps (7.32%) were insufficient. The largest group of apps represents those apps with the "deficient" rating. The very good to good apps had reliable sources, a concrete intent/ purpose in their app description, and a strict distinction of scientific content and advertisement. Apps with the predicates "deficient" or "insufficient" had particularly poor ratings, e.g. in the subscales "information on sources" and "data protection". CONCLUSIONS: Almost half of the tested apps were deficient or insufficient. In order to improve safety of patients using apps, some regulation seems mandatory. Putting apps under the legislation for medical products might be one way to better regulate and control quality. Second, efforts should focus on the development of checklists that make it easier for patients to search for suitable cancer apps.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection causes hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Associations with other cancers are not established. The authors systematically assessed associations between HCV infection and cancers in the US elderly population. METHODS: This was a registry-based case-control study using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data in US adults aged >/=66 years. Cases (n = 1,623,538) were patients who had first cancers identified in SEER registries (1993-2011). Controls (n = 200,000) were randomly selected, cancer-free individuals who were frequency-matched to cases on age, sex, race, and calendar year. Associations with HCV (documented by Medicare claims) were determined using logistic regression. RESULTS: HCV prevalence was higher in cases than in controls (0.7% vs 0.5%). HCV was positively associated with cancers of the liver (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 31.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 29.0-34.3), intrahepatic bile duct (aOR, 3.40; 95% CI, 2.52-4.58), extrahepatic bile duct (aOR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.41-2.57), pancreas (aOR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.09-1.40), and anus (aOR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.42-2.73); nonmelanoma nonepithelial skin cancer (aOR, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.15-2.04); myelodysplastic syndrome (aOR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.33-1.83); and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (aOR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.34-1.84). Specific skin cancers associated with HCV were Merkel cell carcinoma (aOR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.30-2.85) and appendageal skin cancers (aOR, 2.02; 95% CI, 1.29-3.16). Inverse associations were observed with uterine cancer (aOR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.51-0.80) and prostate cancer (aOR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66-0.82). Associations were maintained in sensitivity analyses conducted among individuals without documented alcohol abuse, cirrhosis, or hepatitis B or human immunodeficiency virus infections and after adjustment for socioeconomic status. Associations of HCV with other cancers were not observed. CONCLUSIONS: HCV is associated with increased risk of cancers other than HCC in the US elderly population, notably bile duct cancers and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These results support a possible etiologic role for HCV in an expanded group of cancers. Cancer 2017;123:1202-1211. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Pathology tissue specimens with associated epidemiologic and clinical data are valuable for cancer research. The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial undertook a large-scale effort to create a public resource of pathology tissues from PLCO participants who developed a cancer during the trial. METHODS: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were obtained from pathology laboratories on a loan basis for central processing of tissue microarrays, with additional free-standing tissue cores collected for nucleic acid extraction. RESULTS: Pathology tissue specimens were obtained for prostate cancer (n = 1,052), lung cancer (n = 434), colorectal cancer (n = 675) and adenoma (n = 658), ovarian cancer and borderline tumors (n = 212), breast cancer (n = 870), and bladder cancer (n = 204). The process of creating this resource was complex, involving multidisciplinary teams with expertise in pathology, epidemiology, information technology, project management, and specialized laboratories. CONCLUSIONS: Creating the PLCO tissue resource required a multistep process, including obtaining medical records and contacting pathology departments where pathology materials were stored after obtaining necessary patient consent and authorization. The potential to link tissue biomarkers to prospectively collected epidemiologic information, screening and clinical data, and matched blood or buccal samples offers valuable opportunities to study etiologic heterogeneity, mechanisms of carcinogenesis, and biomarkers for early detection and prognosis. IMPACT: The methods and protocols developed for this effort, and the detailed description of this resource provided here, will be useful for those seeking to use PLCO pathology tissue specimens for their research and may also inform future tissue collection efforts in other settings.

BACKGROUND: Salivary gland cancers (SGCs) are uncommon and account for less than 5% of all head and neck cancers, but they are histologically heterogeneous. No specific therapy, including targeted agents, has consistently improved clinical outcomes in recurrent/metastatic SGC. Recent studies suggest that vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) play important roles in SGC. Nintedanib is a potent small-molecule, triple-receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and VEGFR3; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 [FGFR1], FGFR2, and FGFR3; and PDGFRalpha and PDGFRss). This study sought to determine the antitumor activity of nintedanib in patients with recurrent or metastatic SGC. METHODS: This open-label, multicenter, phase 2, single-arm study was conducted at 11 hospitals in South Korea. Patients with pathologically confirmed recurrent and/or metastatic SGC for whom at least 1 line of systemic chemotherapy had failed were enrolled. Nintedanib was given orally at 200 mg twice a day until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was the response rate. The secondary endpoints were progression-free survival, overall survival, toxicity, and the disease-control rate. The Simon 2-stage minimax design was used. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 54 years, 60% were female, and 95% had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1. The majority of the patients had adenoid cystic carcinoma (65%), and 40% received at least 2 prior rounds of chemotherapy. After 20 patients were enrolled, the study was stopped because no responders were observed at stage I. There were no partial responses, but the disease-control rate was 75% (15 of 20). The median duration of stable disease was 8.2 months (range, 1.76-12.36 months). At the time of the data cutoff, with a median follow-up of 9.5 months, the median overall survival had not been reached, and the progression-free survival rate at 6 months was 60% (95% confidence interval, 0.34-0.79). Grade 3 adverse events included liver enzyme elevation (25%) and nausea/vomiting (5%). Four patients who required a dose reduction because of a grade 3 liver enzyme elevation showed no further grade 3 events. CONCLUSIONS: Single-agent nintedanib did not yield a partial response but did achieve a 75% disease-control rate with long-term stabilization in SGC patients. Because of the high rate and long duration of disease control with a good safety profile, further investigation is warranted. Cancer 2017;123:1958-1964. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: There is considerable scientific interest in associations between protracted low-dose exposure to ionizing radiation and the occurrence of specific types of cancer. METHODS: Associations between ionizing radiation and site-specific solid cancer mortality were examined among 308,297 nuclear workers employed in France, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Workers were monitored for external radiation exposure and follow-up encompassed 8.2 million person-years. Radiation-mortality associations were estimated using a maximum-likelihood method and using a Markov chain Monte Carlo method, the latter used to fit a hierarchical regression model to stabilize estimates of association. RESULTS: The analysis included 17,957 deaths attributable to solid cancer, the most common being lung, prostate, and colon cancer. Using a maximum-likelihood method to quantify associations between radiation dose- and site-specific cancer, we obtained positive point estimates for oral, esophagus, stomach, colon, rectum, pancreas, peritoneum, larynx, lung, pleura, bone and connective tissue, skin, ovary, testis, and thyroid cancer; in addition, we obtained negative point estimates for cancer of the liver and gallbladder, prostate, bladder, kidney, and brain. Most of these estimated coefficients exhibited substantial imprecision. Employing a hierarchical model for stabilization had little impact on the estimated associations for the most commonly observed outcomes, but for less frequent cancer types, the stabilized estimates tended to take less extreme values and have greater precision than estimates obtained without such stabilization. CONCLUSIONS: The results provide further evidence regarding associations between low-dose radiation exposure and cancer.

BACKGROUND: Whether patient navigation improves outcomes for patients with comorbidities is unknown. The aims of this study were to determine the effect of comorbidities on the time to diagnostic resolution after an abnormal cancer screening test and to examine whether patient navigation improves the timeliness and likelihood of diagnostic resolution for patients with comorbidities in comparison with no navigation. METHODS: A secondary analysis of comorbidity data collected by Patient Navigation Research Program sites using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was conducted. The participants were 6,349 patients with abnormal breast, cervical, colon, or prostate cancer screening tests between 2007 and 2011. The intervention was patient navigation or usual care. The CCI data were highly skewed across projects and cancer sites, and the CCI scores were categorized as 0 (CCI score of 0 or no comorbidities identified; 76% of cases); 1 (CCI score of 1; 16% of cases), or 2 (CCI score >/= 2; 8% of cases). Separate adjusted hazard ratios for each site and cancer type were obtained, and then they were pooled with a meta-analysis random effects methodology. RESULTS: Patients with a CCI score >/= 2 had delayed diagnostic resolution after an abnormal cancer screening test in comparison with those with no comorbidities. Patient navigation reduced delays in diagnostic resolution, with the greatest benefits seen for those with a CCI score >/= 2. CONCLUSIONS: Persons with a CCI score >/= 2 experienced significant delays in timely diagnostic care in comparison with patients without comorbidities. Patient navigation was effective in reducing delays in diagnostic resolution among those with CCI scores > 1. Cancer 2017;123:312-318. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Providing high-quality medical care for individuals with cancer during their last year of life involves a range of challenges. An important component of high-quality care during this critical period is ensuring optimal patient satisfaction. The objective of the current study was to assess factors influencing health care ratings among individuals with cancer within 1 year before death. METHODS: The current study used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) data set, a new data resource linking patient-reported information from the CAHPS Medicare Survey with clinical information from the National Cancer Institute's SEER program. The study included 5102 Medicare beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer who completed CAHPS between 1998 and 2011 within 1 year before their death. Multivariable logistic regression analyses examined associations between patient demographic and insurance characteristics with 9 measures of health care experience. RESULTS: Patients with higher general or mental health status were significantly more likely to indicate excellent experience with nearly all measures examined. Sex, race/ethnicity, and education also were found to be significant predictors for certain ratings. Greater time before death predicted an increased likelihood of higher ratings for health plan and specialist physician. Clinical characteristics were found to have few significant associations with experience of care. Individuals in fee-for-service Medicare plans (vs Medicare Advantage) had a greater likelihood of excellent experience with health plans, getting care quickly, and getting needed care. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with cancer within 1 year before death, experience with health plans, physicians, and medical care were found to be associated with sociodemographic, insurance, and clinical characteristics. These findings provide guidance for the development of programs to improve the experience of care among individuals with cancer. Cancer 2017;123:336-344. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and distribution of cancer cases in a defined time period in Somalia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 403 cancer cases were diagnosed between January 01, 2016 and March 01, 2017 in the Department of Pathology at the Somalia Mogadishu-Turkey Education and Research Hospital or the Department of Oncology at Uniso Hospital, Somalia University. Data on cancer type, patient age, and gender were obtained from pathology reports and hospital records. RESULTS: Female patients totaled 49.6% (n = 200) and 50.4% of patients were male (n = 203). The youngest patient was 18 years of age, the oldest was 97, and the average age was 53.4 years. The 10 most common types of cancer were esophageal (n = 130, 32.3%), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 35, 8.7%), liver (n = 26, 6.5%), breast (n = 24, 6.0%), skin (n = 17, 4.2%), thyroid (n = 13, 3.2%), brain (n = 12, 3.0%), bone (n = 11, 2.7%), colorectal (n = 11, 2.7%), and soft tissue (n = 11, 2.7%). The most common site of cancer in both males and females was the esophagus. CONCLUSION: These results show a high incidence of esophageal cancer in Somalia, and strongly suggest that environmental risk factors and nutritional habits have a strong impact in this population. Serious and extensive research on the etiology of esophageal cancer is required.

BACKGROUND: CXCL12 (SDF1) is reported to promote cancer progression in several preclinical models and this is corroborated by the analysis of human tissue specimens. However, the relationship between CXCL12 expression and cancer survival has not been systematically assessed. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the association between CXCL12 expression and cancer survival. RESULTS: Thirty-eight studies inclusive of 5807 patients were included in the analysis of overall, recurrence-free or cancer-specific survival, the majority of which were retrospective. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) for overall and recurrence-free survival in patients with high CXCL12 expression were 1.39 (95% CI: 1.17-1.65, P=0.0002) and 1.12 (95% CI: 0.82-1.53, P=0.48) respectively, but with significant heterogeneity between studies. On subgroup analysis by cancer type, high CXCL12 expression was associated with reduced overall survival in patients with oesophagogastric (HR 2.08; 95% CI: 1.31-3.33, P=0.002), pancreatic (HR 1.54; 95% CI: 1.21-1.97, P=0.0005) and lung cancer (HR 1.37; 95% CI: 1.08-1.75, P=0.01), whereas in breast cancer patients high CXCL12 expression conferred an overall survival advantage (HR 0.5; 95% CI: 0.38-0.66, P<0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: Determination of CXCL12 expression has the potential to be of use as a cancer biomarker and adds prognostic information in various cancer types. Prospective or prospective-retrospective analyses of CXCL12 expression in clearly defined cancer cohorts are now required to advance our understanding of the relationship between CXCL12 expression and cancer outcome.

INTRODUCTION: The national health insurance information system (Sniiram) can be used to estimate the national medical and economic burden of cancer. This study reports the annual rates, characteristics and expenditure of people reimbursed for cancer. METHODS: Among 57 million general health scheme beneficiaries (86% of the French population), people managed for cancer were identified using algorithms based on hospital diagnoses and full refund for long-term cancer. The reimbursed costs (euros) related to the cancer, paid off by the health insurance, were estimated. RESULTS: In 2014, 2.491 million people (4.4%) covered by the general health scheme had a cancer managed (men 1.1 million, 5.1%; women 1.3 million, 4.9%). The annual (2012-2014) average growth rate of patients was 0.8%. The spending related to the cancer was 13.5 billion: 5 billion for primary health care (drugs 2.3 billion), 7.5 billion for the hospital (drugs 1.3 billions) and 900 million for sick leave and invalidity pensions. Spending annual average growth rate (2012-2014) was 4% (drugs 2%). The rates of patients and the relative spending were 1.8% and 2.5 billion for the breast cancer (women), 1.5% and 1.0 billion for prostate cancer, 0.9% and 1.5 billion for the colon cancer, and 0.19% and 1.3 billion for lung cancer. DISCUSSION: Cancers establish one of the first groups of chronic diseases pathologies in terms of patients and spending. If the numbers of patients remain stables, the spending increases, mainly for medicines.

BACKGROUND: Oral contraceptives have been used by hundreds of millions of women around the world. Important questions remain regarding the very long-term cancer risks that are associated with oral contraception. Despite previous research, important questions remain about the safety of these contraceptives: (1) How long do endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer benefits persist? (2) Does combined oral contraceptive use during the reproductive years produce new cancer risks later in life? (3) What is the overall balance of cancer among past users as they enter the later stages of their lives? OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to examine the very long-term cancer risks or benefits associated with the use of combined oral contraceptives, including the estimated overall life-time balance. STUDY DESIGN: The 46,022 women who were recruited to the UK Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study in 1968 and 1969 were observed for up to 44 years. Directly standardized rates of specific and any cancer were calculated for "ever" and "never" users of combined oral contraceptives; data were standardized for age, parity, social class, and smoking. Attributable risk and preventive fraction percentages were calculated. Poisson regression that adjusted for the same variables was used to estimate incidence rate ratios between ever and never users and to examine effects by time since last oral contraceptive use. RESULTS: There were 4661 ever users with at least 1 cancer during 884,895 woman-years of observation and 2341 never users with at least 1 cancer during 388,505 woman-years of observation. Ever use of oral contraceptives was associated with reduced colorectal (incidence rate ratio, 0.81; 99% confidence interval, 0.66-0.99), endometrial (incidence rate ratio, 0.66; 99% confidence interval, 0.48-0.89), ovarian (incidence rate ratio, 0.67; 99% confidence interval, 0.50-0.89), and lymphatic and hematopoietic cancer (incidence rate ratio, 0.74; 99% confidence interval, 0.58-0.94). An increased risk of lung cancer was seen only among ever users who smoked at recruitment. An increased risk of breast and cervical cancer that was seen in current and recent users appeared to be lost within approximately 5 years of stopping oral contraception, with no evidence of either cancer recurring at increased risk in ever users with time. There was no evidence of new cancer risks appearing later in life among women who had used oral contraceptives. Thus, the overall balance of cancer risk among past users of oral contraceptives was neutral with the increased risks counterbalanced by the endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer benefits that persist at least 30 years. CONCLUSION: Most women who choose to use oral contraceptives do not expose themselves to long-term cancer harms; instead, with some cancers, many women benefit from important reductions of risk that persist for many years after stopping.

BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to determine the effect of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on overall survival in patients with surgically managed pT3-T4aN0 laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). METHODS: A review of the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 through 2013 was performed. Patients with surgically managed pT3-4aN0 laryngeal SCC with negative surgical margins were included. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were used to determine factors associated with survival. RESULTS: A total of 1460 patients were included, 46.2% of whom had pT3N0 disease (674 patients) and 53.8% of whom had pT4aN0 disease (786 patients). Approximately 72.0% of the patients with pT3N0 disease (485 patients) and 50.1% of the patients with pT4aN0 disease (394 patients) received PORT. PORT was not found to be associated with improved overall survival on univariable analysis for patients with pT3N0 disease (hazard ratio [HR], 0.84; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.62-1.14), but was for patients with pT4aN0 disease (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.45-0.71). For patients with pT3N0 SCC of the larynx, in a multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusting for age >65 years, severity of comorbidities, larynx subsite, extent of laryngectomy, and number of lymph nodes removed, PORT was not found to be associated with improved survival (adjusted HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.64-1.21). For patients with pT4aN0 disease, the administration of PORT was associated with improved survival on multivariable analysis adjusting for age >65 years, severity of comorbidities, larynx subsite, number of lymph nodes removed, and type of hospital (adjusted HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.46-0.73). CONCLUSIONS: For patients with surgically managed pT3N0 laryngeal SCC with negative margins, PORT does not appear to be associated with improved survival. Despite a survival benefit, nearly 50% of patients with pT4aN0 laryngeal SCC and negative surgical margins do not receive standard-of-care PORT. Cancer 2017;123:2248-2257.

BACKGROUND: Smoking is known to be carcinogenic and an important factor in the outcome of cancer treatment. However, to the authors' knowledge, smoking habits and smoking cessation counseling in patients with cancer have been poorly studied. The authors sought to analyze smoking habits among Americans diagnosed with cancer in a nationally representative dataset. METHODS: The cancer supplement of the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) in 2010 was used to obtain information regarding self-reported smoking behavior in a representative sample of the US population. Cancer history, smoking history, quitting behavior, cessation counseling, cessation approaches, and sociodemographic variables were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 27,157 individuals were interviewed for the NHIS in 2010, representing 216,052,891 individuals, 7,058,135 of whom had ever smoked and 13,188,875 of whom had been told that they had cancer. Approximately 51.7% of individuals diagnosed with cancer and who were active smokers reported being counseled to quit smoking by a health professional within the previous 12 months. Cancer survivors were no more likely to quit smoking than individuals in the general population. Those diagnosed with a tobacco-related cancer were found to be no more likely to report quitting smoking than those with other types of cancers. Rates of quitting did not appear to vary based on the type of smoking cessation method used (P = .50). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cancer, including those diagnosed with a tobacco-related cancer, do not appear to be more likely to quit smoking than the general population. Only approximately one-half of patients with cancer who smoke are counseled to quit. Smoking cessation in patients with cancer is an important area for intervention and investigation.

BACKGROUND: Frailty has been suggested as a construct for oncologists to consider in treating older cancer patients. Therefore, the authors assessed the potential of creating a deficit-accumulation frailty index (DAFI) from a largely self-administered comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA). METHODS: Five hundred patients aged >/=65 years underwent a CGA before receiving chemotherapy. A DAFI was constructed, resulting in a 51-item scale, and cutoff values were examined for patients in the robust/nonfrail (cutoff value, 0.0 < 0.2), prefrail (cutoff value, 0.2 < 0.35), and frail (cutoff value, >/= 0.35) groups. RESULTS: Two hundred and fifty patients (50%) were nonfrail, 197 (39%) were prefrail, and 52 (11%) were frail. Older patients (aged >/= 80 years) and those who had lower education, were living alone, and had higher stage disease were associated with prefrail/frail status. Prefrail/frail patients were more likely to have grade >/=3 toxicity but not to have a dose delay or reduction, and they were more likely to discontinue drug and be hospitalized. The association with grade >/=3 toxicity was attenuated by controlling for a toxicity risk calculator, but the other outcomes were not. CONCLUSIONS: A deficit-accumulation frailty index can be constructed from a CGA in older patients with cancer and can indicate the frailty status of the population. The frailty status so determined is associated both with outcomes likely because of chemotherapy toxicity and with those likely because of age-related physiologic and functional deficits and thus can be useful in the overall assessment of the patient.

BACKGROUND: Patient navigation is a barrier-focused program of care coordination designed to achieve timely and high-quality cancer-related care for medically underserved racial-ethnic minorities and the poor. However, to the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have examined the relationship between satisfaction with navigators and cancer-related care. METHODS: The authors included data from 1345 patients with abnormal cancer screening tests or a definitive cancer diagnosis who participated in the Patient Navigation Research Program to test the efficacy of patient navigation. Participants completed demographic questionnaires and measures of patient satisfaction with cancer-related care (PSCC) and patient satisfaction with interpersonal relationship with navigator (PSN-I). The authors obtained descriptive statistics to characterize the sample and conducted regression analyses to assess the degree of association between PSN-I and PSCC, controlling for demographic and clinical factors. Analyses of variance were conducted to examine group differences controlling for statistically significant covariates. RESULTS: Statistically significant relationships were found between the PSCC and PSN-I for patients with abnormal cancer screening tests (1040 patients; correlation coefficient (r), 0.4 [P<.001]) and those with a definitive cancer diagnosis (305 patients; correlation coefficient, 0.4 [P<.001]). The regression analysis indicated that having an abnormal colorectal cancer screening test in the abnormal screening test group and increased age and minority race-ethnicity status in the cancer diagnosis group were associated with a higher satisfaction with cancer care (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: Satisfaction with navigators appears to be significantly associated with satisfaction with cancer-related care. Information regarding the patient-navigator relationship should be integrated into patient navigation programs to maximize the likelihood of reducing caner disparities and mortality for medically underserved racial-ethnic minorities and the poor.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a predictive biomarker for the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors, regardless of the tumor type. While clinical characteristics of MSI cancer patients have been largely described in tumor localizations frequently associated with this genetic phenotype (i.e. colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer), it remains poorly characterized in other neoplasms. Pan-tumor high-throughput genome sequence analyses have contributed to the broadening of knowledge about the landscape of MSI. This review aims at synthetizing the literature concerning the frequency of MSI status in solid cancers, according to the cancer stage and the hereditary or sporadic origin of the mismatch repair deficiency. We then check for other cancers frequently associated with MSI and describe the clinical and pathological characteristics that should suggest a MSI phenotype.

BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study was to examine social functioning among adolescents and young adults (AYAs) within the first 2 years after a cancer diagnosis and compare their scores with population norms and identify trajectories of social functioning over time and its correlates. METHODS: A multicenter, longitudinal study was conducted among 215 AYA patients with cancer aged 14 to 39 years. A total of 141 patients completed a self-report measure of social functioning within the first 4 months of diagnosis and again at 12 months and 24 months later. RESULTS: AYA patients with cancer were found to have significantly worse social functioning scores around the time of diagnosis (52.0 vs 85.1; P<.001), at the 12-month follow-up (73.1 vs 85.1; P<.001), and at the 24-month follow-up (69.2 vs 85.1; P<.001) when compared with population norms. Significant improvements in social functioning from baseline to the 12-month follow-up were observed; however, social functioning levels remained stable thereafter. Among participants, 9% demonstrated consistently high/normal social functioning, 47% demonstrated improved social functioning, 13% were found to have worsening social functioning, and 32% demonstrated consistently low social functioning. AYA patients with cancer who had consistently low social functioning were more often off treatment at the time of follow-up, reported more physical symptoms and higher levels of distress at baseline and follow-up, and perceived less social support at baseline compared with the other 3 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although improved over time, social functioning still was found to be compromised 24 months after the primary diagnosis. Nearly one-third of these patients remain at risk of poor social functioning. Reducing physical symptoms and psychological distress and enhancing social support by interventions during the period after treatment may potentially help these young survivors to better reintegrate into society.

BACKGROUND: The impact of cancer on socioeconomic outcomes is attracting attention as the number of survivors of cancer in young age continues to rise. This study examines economic independence in a national cohort of survivors of cancer at a young age in Norway. METHODS: Through the linkage of several national registries, the study cohort comprised 1,212,013 individuals born in Norway during 1965 through 1985, of which 5440 had received a cancer diagnosis before age 25 years. Follow-up was through 2007, and the main outcomes were receipt of governmental financial assistance, employment, income, and occupation. Analytic methods included Cox proportional hazard regression, log-binomial regression, and quantile regression models. RESULTS: Individuals in the cancer survivor group had an increased probability of receiving governmental financial assistance (men: hazard ratio [HR], 1.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-1.5; women: HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.6) and of not being employed (men: HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.7; women: HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.2-1.6) compared with those in the noncancer group. Income discrepancies were particularly pronounced for survivors of central nervous system tumors. There was no difference in representation in higher skilled occupations. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of cancer at a young age in Norway had an increased risk of being economically dependent and unemployed. This was evident in several tumor groups and was most pronounced in female survivors. There were only small differences in income or representation in higher skilled occupations for most employed survivors compared with the noncancer group. The current results are important for understanding the impact of a cancer diagnosis at a young age on subsequent job market outcomes. Cancer 2016;122:3873-3882. (c) 2016 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary complications after cancer therapy are varied. This study describes pulmonary outcomes among childhood cancer survivors and evaluates their impact on daily activities. METHODS: The incidence of pulmonary outcomes (asthma, chronic cough, emphysema, lung fibrosis, oxygen need, and recurrent pneumonia) reported among 5-year cancer survivors (n = 14,316) and the incidence of death due to pulmonary causes among all eligible survivors (n = 20,690) in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study were compared with those for sibling controls (n = 4027) with cumulative incidence, standardized mortality ratio (SMR), and piecewise exponential models. Logistic regression with random effects was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for activity limitations with pulmonary complications. RESULTS: By the age of 45 years, the cumulative incidence of any pulmonary condition was 29.6% (95% CI, 29.1%-30.0%) for cancer survivors and 26.5% (95% CI, 24.9%-28.0%) for siblings. Fewer survivors reported ever smoking (23.6% vs 36.4%, P < .001), but survivors were more likely to report chronic cough (rate ratio [RR], 1.6; 95% CI, 1.4-1.9), oxygen need (RR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5-2.2), lung fibrosis (RR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.3-5.4), and recurrent pneumonia (RR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.4-3.0). The SMR for death due to pulmonary causes was 5.9 (95% CI, 4.2-8.1), and it was associated with platinum exposure and lung radiation (P < .01). The impact of chronic cough on daily activities for survivors (OR vs survivors without chronic cough, 2.7) was greater than that for siblings (OR, 2.0; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Pulmonary complications are substantial among adult survivors of childhood cancer and can affect daily activities. Cancer 2016;122:3687-96. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Fatigue is the most common symptom negatively affecting the quality of life of patients with cancer. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and safety of 10.6-mum infrared laser moxibustion for cancer-related fatigue (CRF). METHODS: The authors conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial among 78 patients with cancer who were diagnosed with CRF. The group treated with infrared laser moxibustion received 10.6 mum of infrared laser moxibustion on the ST36 (bilateral), CV4, and CV6 acupoints. Each participant received a 20-minute treatment session 3 times per week for 4 weeks. The sham group received the same treatment duration on the same acupoints, but without infrared laser output. The outcome was change in fatigue as measured by the Chinese version of the Brief Fatigue Inventory between groups at week 4 with additional evaluation at week 8 for durability of treatment effects. A mixed effects model was used to evaluate the difference in treatment effect over time. RESULTS: Among those randomized, 61 patients (78%) completed the entire study. At the end of the intervention, the individuals in the group treated with the laser were found to have significantly less fatigue than those in the sham group (3.01 vs 4.40; P = .002). The improvement in fatigue persisted to week 8, favoring the group treated with laser moxibustion (3.03 vs 4.26; P = .006). Laser moxibustion was safe, with 3 cases of mild local erythema that resolved without medical intervention reported. CONCLUSIONS: Infrared laser moxibustion appeared to be safe and efficacious for improving CRF in a Chinese patient population. Larger studies in more racial/ethnically diverse populations are needed to confirm the benefit of this technique for fatigue in patients with cancer. Cancer 2016;122:3667-72. (c) 2016 The Authors.

Emerging evidence supports the pivotal roles of cancer-associated cachexia in breast cancer progression. However, the mediators and mechanisms that mediate cancer-induced cachexia remain unclear. Here, we show that breast cancer-derived exosomes alter adipocytes and muscle cells in terms of increased catabolism characterized by the release of metabolites. Likewise, tumour cells cocultivated with mature adipocytes or C2C12 exhibit an aggressive phenotype through inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Mechanistically, we show that cancer cell-secreted miR-155 promotes beige/brown differentiation and remodel metabolism in resident adipocytes by downregulating the PPARgamma expression, but does not significantly affect biological conversion in C2C12. In vitro the use of propranolol ameliorates tumour exosomes-associated cachectic wasting through upregulating the PPARgamma expression. These results demonstrate that cancer-derived exosomes reprogram systemic energy metabolism and accelerate cancer-associated cachexia to facilitate tumour progression.

BACKGROUND: In the United States, an estimated 48 million individuals live without health insurance. The purpose of the current study was to explore the Variation in insurance status by patient demographics and tumor site among nonelderly adult patients with cancer. METHODS: A total of 688,794 patients aged 18 to 64 years who were diagnosed with one of the top 25 incident cancers (representing 95% of all cancer diagnoses) between 2007 and 2010 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were analyzed. Patient characteristics included age, race, sex, marital status, and rural or urban residence. County-level demographics included percent poverty level. Insurance status was defined as having non-Medicaid insurance, Medicaid coverage, or no insurance. RESULTS: On multivariate logistic regression analyses, younger age, male sex, nonwhite race, being unmarried, residence in counties with higher levels of poverty, and rural residence were associated with being uninsured versus having non-Medicaid insurance (all P <.001). The highest rates of non-Medicaid insurance were noted among patients with prostate cancer (92.3%), melanoma of the skin (92.5%), and thyroid cancer (89.5%), whereas the lowest rates of non-Medicaid insurance were observed among patients with cervical cancer (64.2%), liver cancer (67.9%), and stomach cancer (70.9%) (P <.001). Among uninsured individuals, the most prevalent cancers were lung cancer (14.9%), colorectal cancer (12.1%), and breast cancer (10.2%) (P <.001). Lung cancer caused the majority of cancer mortality in all insurance groups. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of insurance coverage vary greatly by demographics and by cancer type. The expansion of health insurance coverage would be expected to disproportionally benefit certain demographic populations and cancer types.

INTRODUCTION: Advanced imaging can inform prognosis and may be a mechanism to de-escalate unnecessary end-of-life care in patients with cancer. Associations between greater use of advanced imaging and less-aggressive end-of-life care in real-world practice has not been examined. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of SEER-Medicare data on patients who died from breast, lung, colorectal, or prostate cancer between 2002 and 2007. Hospital referral region (HRR)-level use of computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography was categorized by tertile of imaging use and correlated with hospice enrollment overall and late hospice enrollment using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: A total of 55,058 patients met study criteria. Hospice use ranged from 50.8% (colorectal cancer) to 62.1% (prostate cancer). In multivariable analyses, hospital referral regions (HRRs) with high rates of CT imaging were associated with lower odds of hospice enrollment (odds ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.90) and late enrollment among those who did enroll (odds ratio, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.26-1.76). HRRs with the highest rates of CT use were predominantly located in the Midwest and Northeast and associated with higher percentage population of black patients (14.5 vs 5.6%), greater comorbidity (28.4 vs 23.7%), metropolitan residence (93.9 vs 78.5%), and less than high school education (26.4 vs 19.3%). CONCLUSION: In this population-based retrospective study, we did not observe evidence that overall and timely hospice are associated with higher rates of imaging near the end of life. An observed association between higher rates of imaging, particularly CT, may be explained in part by HRR-level differences in practice patterns and patient demographic characteristics. Further research is warranted to explore the ability of oncologic imaging to appropriately de-escalate care.

Purpose Among individuals with advanced cancer, frequent hospitalization increasingly is viewed as a hallmark of poor-quality care. We examined hospitalization rates and individual- and hospital-level predictors of rehospitalization among individuals with advanced cancer in the year after diagnosis. Methods Individuals diagnosed with advanced breast, colorectal, non-small-cell lung, or pancreatic cancer from 2009 to 2012 (N = 25,032) were identified with data from the California Cancer Registry (CCR). After linkage with inpatient discharge data, multistate and log-linear Poisson regression models were used to calculate hospitalization rates and to model rehospitalization in the year after diagnosis, accounting for survival. Results In the year after diagnosis, 71% of individuals with advanced cancer were hospitalized, 16% had three or more hospitalizations, and 64% of hospitalizations originated in the emergency department. Rehospitalization rates were significantly associated with black non-Hispanic (incidence rate ratio [IRR], 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.42) and Hispanic (IRR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.03 to 1.20) race/ethnicity; public insurance (IRR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.23 to 1.47) and no insurance (IRR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.02 to 1.35); lower socioeconomic status quintiles (IRRs, 1.09 to 1.29); comorbidities (IRRs, 1.13 to 1.59); and pancreatic (IRR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.95 to 2.20) and non-small-cell lung (IRR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.54 to 1.86) cancers versus colorectal cancer. Rehospitalization rates were significantly lower after discharge from a hospital that had an outpatient palliative care program (IRR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.83 to 0.97) and were higher after discharge from a for-profit hospital (IRR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.56). Conclusion Individuals with advanced cancer experience a heavy burden of hospitalization in the year after diagnosis. Efforts to reduce hospitalization and provide care congruent with patient preferences might target individuals at higher risk. Future work might explore access to palliative care in the community and related health care use among individuals with advanced cancer.

BACKGROUND: Diabetes is associated with an increased risk of several cancers; however, greater detection of cancer around the time of diabetes diagnosis may partly contribute to this relationship. The goal of the current study was to explore the temporal relationship between diabetes and cancer incidence. METHODS: The authors conducted a retrospective, population-based cohort study of >1 million adults living in Ontario, Canada to evaluate the association between diabetes diagnosis and the incidence of cancer in 3 time periods: within the 10 years before a diabetes diagnosis, within the first 3 months after a diabetes diagnosis, and from 3 months to 10 years after a diabetes diagnosis. RESULTS: Individuals with diabetes were significantly more likely to have been diagnosed with cancer within the 10 years before a diabetes diagnosis compared with individuals without diabetes (odds ratio, 1.23; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.19-1.27). Cancer incidence also was found to be significantly higher in individuals with diabetes within the 3-month period after a diabetes diagnosis (hazard ratio, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.52-1.74), whereas the risk was not found to be elevated in the later period (hazard ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.95-0.98). Similar trends were noted for individual cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that individuals with diabetes had a significantly higher risk of most cancers, which was limited to the time periods before and immediately after a diabetes diagnosis. The highest risk period was observed within the first 3 months after a diabetes diagnosis, suggesting a partial role of detection bias in the apparent relationship between diabetes and cancer.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about infections among adult survivors of childhood cancer. The authors report the occurrence of infections and risk factors for infections in a large cohort of survivors of childhood cancer. METHODS: The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study cohort was used to compare incidence rates of infections among 12,360 5-year survivors of childhood cancer with the rates of 4023 siblings. Infection-related mortality of survivors was compared with that of the US population. Demographic and treatment variables were analyzed using Poisson regression to determine the rate ratios (RRs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations with infectious complications. RESULTS: Compared with the US population, survivors were at an increased risk of death from infectious causes (standardized mortality ratio [SMR], 4.2; 95% CI, 3.2-5.4), with the greatest risk observed among females (SMR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.5-6.9) and among those who had been exposed to total body irradiation (SMR, 7.8; 95% CI, 1.8-33.0). Survivors also reported higher rates than siblings of overall infectious complications (RR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.2-1.4) and higher rates of all categories of infection. CONCLUSIONS: Survivors of childhood cancer remain at elevated risk for developing infectious-related complications, and they have a higher risk of infection-related mortality years after therapy. Further investigation is needed to provide insight into the mechanisms for the observed excess risks.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary imaging often identifies suspicious abnormalities resulting in supplementary diagnostic procedures. This study aims to investigate whether the metabolic fingerprint of plasma allows to discriminate between patients with lung inflammation and patients with lung cancer. METHODS: Metabolic profiles of plasma from 347 controls, 269 cancer patients and 108 patients with inflammation were obtained by (1)H-NMR spectroscopy. Models to discriminate between groups were trained by PLS-LDA. A test set was used for independent validation. A ROC curve was built to evaluate the diagnostic performance of potential biomarkers. RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of PET-CT to diagnose cancer are 96, 23, 76 and 71%. Metabolic profiles differentiate between cancer and inflammation with a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 87% and a MCE of 12%. Removal of the glutamate metabolite results in an increase of MCE (38%) and a decrease of both sensitivity and specificity (62%), demonstrating the importance of glutamate for discrimination. At the cut-off point 0.31 on the ROC curve, the relative glutamate concentration discriminates between cancer and inflammation with a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of 81%, and an AUC of 0.88. PPV and NPV are 92 and 69%. In PET-positive patients with a relative glutamate level </= 0.31 the sensitivity to diagnose cancer reaches 100% with a PPV of 94%. In PET-negative patients, a relative glutamate level > 0.31 increases the specificity of PET from 23% to 58% and results in a high NPV of 100%. In case of discrepancy between SUVmax and the glutamate concentration, lung cancer is missed in 19% of the cases. CONCLUSION: This study indicates that the (1)H-NMR-derived relative plasma concentration of glutamate allows discrimination between lung cancer and lung inflammation. A glutamate level </= 0.31 in PET-positive patients corresponds to the diagnosis of lung cancer with a higher specificity and PPV than PET-CT. Glutamate levels > 0.31 in patients with PET negative lung lesions is likely to correspond with inflammation. Caution is needed for patients with conflicting SUVmax values and glutamate concentrations. Confirmation is needed in a prospective study with external validation and by another analytical technique such as HPLC-MS.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors treated with abdominal or pelvic radiation therapy (RT) for childhood cancer have an increased risk of colorectal cancer. However, clinical guidelines are inconsistent on recommendations regarding the early initiation of screening in these patients due to the lack of supporting evidence that these patients pass through a pre-invasive phase, in which adenomatous polyps can be detected and removed. AIMS: To determine the prevalence of adenomatous polyps in cancer survivors treated with RT for childhood cancer; the prevalence in average-risk patients aged 17-49; and the prevalence in average-risk patients aged 50-75. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study comparing the prevalence of adenomatous polyps among three patient groups: childhood cancer survivors aged 17-49 with prior RT who underwent colonoscopy screening from 2006 to 2017; age- and gender-matched patients in the average-risk population; and average-risk patients aged 50-75. RESULTS: One hundred and forty-five patients were included in the study. The proportion of patients with adenomatous polyps in the cancer survivor group was significantly higher than that in the age- and gender-matched average-risk group (58.6 vs 17.2%, p = 0.00) and higher than the average-risk group aged 50-75 (58.6 vs 27.6%, p = 0.009). The prevalence of adenomas with high-risk features was higher in the survivor group compared to patients aged 50-75 (20.7 vs 3.5%, p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors treated with RT for childhood cancer have a higher prevalence of adenomatous polyps compared to the average-risk population. These findings support the early initiation of colonoscopy screening 10 years after radiation therapy, even in patients who have received RT doses below 30 Gy.

BACKGROUND: Mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) genes are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers in women. The cancer characteristics of men with BRCA1/2 mutations are less well studied. This study describes the unique cancer characteristics of male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers at our institution. METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review on male patients who were seen between January 2004 and December 2014 and tested positive for a BRCA1/2 mutation. We evaluated clinical characteristics, pathology findings, treatment selection and survival. RESULTS: A total of 102 male patients were identified who tested positive for a BRCA1/2 deleterious mutation. Of these 102 patients, 33 (32%) had a diagnosis of cancer. Of these 33 patients with cancer, the majority (20 patients) were found to carry a BRCA2 mutation. Median age of cancer diagnosis was 65 years (Range: 35-75 years). Of the 33 patients diagnosed with cancer, 8 had two or more cancers, including 1 patient who had 4 cancers. Prostate cancer was the most commonly diagnosed cancer, seen in 13 patients, 11 of whom were BRCA2 positive. These cancers tended to have higher Gleason scores and elevated PSA levels. The majority of these prostate cancer patients were alive and disease free at a median follow-up of 7.4 years. Male breast cancer was the second most common cancer seen in 9 patients, all of whom were BRCA2 positive. The majority of these cancers were high grade, hormone receptor positive and associated with lymph node metastases. There were no breast cancer related deaths. Other cancers included bladder cancer, pancreatic cancer, melanoma and other skin cancers. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the cancer characteristics and outcomes of male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers. A third of male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers had a diagnosis of cancer. A significant number of patients (mostly BRCA2 mutation positive) developed multiple cancers, which may have important implications for cancer screening and prevention. Despite having high grade histology and advanced stage at diagnosis, male BRCA1/2 mutation carriers with breast and prostate cancer demonstrated a favorable 5-year survival.

BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, the causal link between human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and squamous cell carcinoma of the anus (SCCA) has been well described. Because HPV infection in one site is often associated with other sites of infection, it then follows that patients with SCCA may have an increased risk of additional HPV-related cancers. Identifying and targeting at-risk sites through cancer screening and surveillance may help to guide best practices. The current study sought to ascertain sites and risk of HPV-related second primary malignancies (SPMs) in survivors of SCCA. METHODS: Using population-based data from 1992 through 2012, the authors identified patients with SCCA and determined their risk of HPV-related SPMs, including anal, oral, and genital cancers. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), defined as observed to expected cases, were calculated to determine excess risk. RESULTS: Of 10,537 patients with SCCA, 416 developed HPV-related SPMs, which corresponded to an overall SIR of 21.5 (99% confidence interval [99% CI], 19.0-24.2). Men were found to have a higher SIR (35.8; 99% CI, 30.7-41.6) compared with women (12.8; 99% CI, 10.4-15.5). SIRs for a second SCCA were markedly higher in men (127.5; 99% CI, 108.1-149.2) compared with women (47.0; 99% CI, 34.7-62.1), whereas SIRs for oral cavity and pharyngeal cancers were elevated in men (3.1; 99% CI, 1.5-5.7) and women (4.4; 99% CI, 1.5-9.7). SIRs for sex-specific sites also were elevated, with male genital cancers having an SIR of 19.6 (99% CI, 8.7-37.6) and female genital cancers an SIR of 8.3 (99% CI, 6.1-11.0). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with index SCCA are at an increased risk of subsequent HPV-related SPMs. The elevated risk is most striking in patients with second primary SCCAs; however, the risk of second cancers also appears to be increased in other HPV-related sites.

BACKGROUND: The number of cancer survivors is steadily increasing and these patients often experience long-lasting health problems. To make care for cancer survivors sustainable for the future, it would be relevant to put the effects of cancer in this phase into perspective. Therefore, the authors compared health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and health care use among cancer survivors with that of patients with chronic diseases. METHODS: Patients diagnosed at age >18 years with a cancer with a 5-year survival rate > 20% and no distant metastases at the time of diagnosis and patients aged >18 years with physician-diagnosed somatic chronic diseases without cancer were sent a questionnaire. HRQOL was measured with the RAND-36, a measure of HRQOL. Self-reported health care use was measured for general practitioner care, specialist care, rehabilitative care, physical therapy, ambulatory mental health care, and occupational health care. RESULTS: A total of 601 cancer survivors and 1052 patients with chronic diseases without cancer were included in the current study. Multimorbidity was observed in 63% of the cancer survivors and 61% of the patients with chronic diseases. The HRQOL of the cancer survivors was significantly better than that of patients with chronic diseases after adjustment for age and sex. For the mental functioning subscale, no significant differences were found between the 2 groups. Cancer survivors were found to be less likely to have visited a general practitioner or cardiologist compared with patients with chronic diseases. CONCLUSIONS: When considering physical HRQOL and health care use, cancer survivors appear to fare better than the average patient with chronic diseases. No difference in mental functioning was observed in the current study.

BACKGROUND: Social and family factors can influence the health outcomes and quality of life of informal caregivers. Little is known about the distribution and correlates of such factors for caregivers of cancer patients. This study sought to fill this gap with data from the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance consortium. METHODS: Lung and colorectal cancer patients nominated an informal caregiver to participate in a caregiving survey. Caregivers reported their sociodemographic and caregiving characteristics, social stress, relationship quality with the patient, and family functioning. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlations were used to assess the distribution of caregivers' social factors. Multivariable linear regressions assessed the independent correlates of each social factor. RESULTS: Most caregivers reported low to moderate levels of social stress and good relationship quality and family functioning. In multivariable analyses, older age was associated with less social stress and better family functioning but worse relationship quality, with effect sizes (Cohen's d) up to 0.40 (P < .05). Caring for a female patient was associated with less social stress and better relationship quality but worse family functioning (effect sizes </= 0.16, P < .05). Few caregiving characteristics were associated with social stress, whereas several were significant independent correlates of relationship quality. Finally, social factors were important independent correlates of one another. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the importance of personal and caregiving-related characteristics and the broader family context to social factors. Future work is needed to better understand these pathways and assess whether interventions targeting social factors can improve health or quality-of-life outcomes for informal cancer caregivers.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer has a significant heritable component, and rare deleterious germline variants in certain genes can increase the risk of the disease. The aim of the current study was to describe the prevalence of pathogenic germline variants in cancer-predisposing genes in men with prostate cancer and at least 1 additional primary cancer. METHODS: Using a multigene panel, the authors sequenced germline DNA from 102 men with prostate cancer and at least 1 additional primary cancer who also met >/=1 of the following criteria: 1) age </=55 years at the time of diagnosis of the first malignancy; 2) rare tumor type or atypical presentation of a common tumor; and/or 3) >/=3 primary malignancies. Cancer family history and clinicopathologic data were independently reviewed by a clinical genetic counselor to determine whether the patient met established criteria for testing for a hereditary cancer syndrome. RESULTS: Sequencing identified approximately 3500 variants. Nine protein-truncating deleterious mutations were found across 6 genes, including BRCA2, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), mutL homolog 1 (MLH1), BRCA1 interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1), partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2), and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). Likely pathogenic missense variants were identified in checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) and homeobox protein Hox-B13 (HOXB13). In total, 11 of 102 patients (10.8%) were found to have pathogenic or likely pathogenic mutations in cancer-predisposing genes. The majority of these men (64%) did not meet current clinical criteria for germline testing. CONCLUSIONS: Men with prostate cancer and at least 1 additional primary cancer are enriched for harboring a germline deleterious mutation in a cancer-predisposing gene that may impact cancer prognosis and treatment, but the majority do not meet current criteria for clinical genetic testing.

BACKGROUND: With prior reports indicating a lack of progress in survival improvement in older adolescents and young adults (AYAs) aged 15 to 39 years with cancer compared with both younger and older patients with cancer, the current analysis provides an update of survival trends of cancers among AYAs, children, and older adults. METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database for 13 regions were used to ascertain survival trends of the 34 most frequent cancers diagnosed in AYAs compared with children and older adults. RESULTS: As of 2002 through 2006, the 5-year relative survival rate for all invasive cancers in AYAs was 82.5% (standard error, 0.2%). In AYAs, 14 cancers demonstrated evidence of a statistically significant improvement in their 5-year relative survival since 1992. Survival improved less in AYAs than in children for acute myeloid leukemia and medulloblastoma. Fourteen cancers had survival improvements that were found to be less in AYAs compared with older adults, including hepatic carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, high-grade astrocytoma, acute lymphocytic leukemia, pancreatic carcinoma, low-grade astrocytoma, gastric carcinoma, renal carcinoma, cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, Hodgkin lymphoma, ovarian cancer, fibromatous sarcoma, other soft tissue sarcoma, and thyroid carcinoma. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in the survival of several cancer types that occur frequently in AYAs are encouraging. However, survival does not appear to be improving to the same extent in AYAs as in children or older adults for several cancers. Further investment in exploring the distinct biology of tumors in this age group, and of their hosts, must be a priority in AYA oncology.

BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for patients with brain metastases remains controversial as the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) alone, replacing whole-brain radiation therapy (WBRT), has increased. This study determined the patterns of care at multiple institutions before 2010 and examined whether or not survival was different between patients treated with SRS and patients treated with WBRT. METHODS: This study examined the overall survival of patients treated with radiation therapy for brain metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC; initially diagnosed in 2007-2009) or breast cancer (initially diagnosed in 1997-2009) at 5 centers. Propensity score analyses were performed to adjust for confounding factors such as the number of metastases, the extent of extracranial metastases, and the treatment center. RESULTS: Overall, 27.8% of 400 NSCLC patients and 13.4% of 387 breast cancer patients underwent SRS alone for the treatment of brain metastases. Few patients with more than 3 brain metastases or lesions >/= 4 cm in size underwent SRS. Patients with fewer than 4 brain metastases less than 4 cm in size (n = 189 for NSCLC and n = 117 for breast cancer) who were treated with SRS had longer survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] for NSCLC, 0.58; 95% confidence Interval [CI], 0.38-0.87; P = .01; adjusted HR for breast cancer, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.33-0.91; P = .02) than those treated with WBRT. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated for fewer than 4 brain metastases from NSCLC or breast cancer with SRS alone had longer survival than those treated with WBRT in this multi-institutional, retrospective study, even after adjustments for the propensity to undergo SRS.

OBJECTIVE: The most distinctive feature of FDG-PET cancer screening program is the ability to find various kinds of malignant neoplasms in a single test. The aim of this survey is to clarify the range and frequency of various malignant neoplasms detected by FDG-PET cancer screening performed in Japan. METHODS: "FDG-PET cancer screening" was defined as FDG-PET or positron emission tomography and computed tomography (PET/CT) scan with or without other tests performed for cancer screening of healthy subjects. This survey was based on a questionnaire regarding FDG-PET cancer screening. We analyzed the situation of 9 less frequently found malignant neoplasms including malignant lymphoma, malignancy of head and neck, esophagus, hepatobiliary and gallbladder, pancreas, kidney, cervical and uterine, ovary, and bladder. RESULTS: The detailed information of subjects with the suspected 9 kinds of malignant neoplasms mentioned above in the FDG-PET cancer screening program was studied in a total of 1,219 cases from 212 facilities. A statistical significance between PET/CT and PET was found in relative sensitivity and PPV for renal cell cancer. Malignant lymphoma was frequently of indolent type, suspected head and neck cancers had many false-positive results, and pancreatic cancer detected in this program was often in the advanced stage even in asymptomatic subjects. The recommendation of combined screening modality to PET or PET/CT was as follows: gastric endoscopy for assessing early esophageal cancer; abdominal ultrasound for screening hepatobiliary and gallbladder cancer; pelvic magnetic resonance imaging for assessing gynecological and pelvic cancers; and the CA125 blood test for screening ovarian cancer. Delayed image was helpful depending on the type of suspected malignant neoplasm. CONCLUSION: We analyzed various types of malignant neoplasms detected by the FDG-PET cancer screening program and presented recommended combination of examinations to cover FDG-PET and PET/CT.

BACKGROUND: Burden of cancer is increasing in developing countries, where healthcare infrastructures and resources are limited. Evaluating the pattern of care would provide evidence for planning and improvement of the situation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied the pattern of residential place and clinical information of cancer patients who were admitted to the Cancer Institute of Iran from January 1, to May 31, 2012. RESULTS: We studied 1,705 consecutive cancer patients admitted to the Cancer Institute in the study period. The most common cancers were breast (29.2%), colorectal (9.0%), stomach (8.3%), head & neck (8.0%) and esophageal (3.8%) cancers. Radiotherapy was the main treatment (52.1%) followed by chemotherapy (43.8%) and surgery (29.1%). We found that 60% of the patients presented in the loco-regional or advanced stages. About 35% of patients travelled from other provinces mainly from Mazandaran (13.4%), Lorestan (10.6%), Zanjan (7.8%) and Ghazvin (6.6%). On average, the cancer patients travelled about 455 kilometers to receive care in the cancer institute. We found more than 38% patients who were referred from other provinces had an early stage tumor. CONCLUSION: Establishment of comprehensive cancer centers in different geographical regions and implementation of a proper referral system for advanced cancer patients is needed to improve the patient outcomes and mitigate the burden of travel of patients for cancer care.

BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that the clinical course of venous thromboembolism in patients with active cancer may differ according to the specificities of primary tumor site. AIM AND METHODS: We used data from RIETE (international registry of patients with venous thromboembolism) to compare the clinical venous thromboembolism-related outcomes during the course of anticoagulation in patients with one of the 4 more frequent cancers (breast, prostate, colorectal, or lung cancer). RESULTS: As of September 2014, 3947 cancer patients were recruited, of whom 938 had breast, 629 prostate, 1189 colorectal, and 1191 lung cancer. Overall, 55% had metastatic disease (42%, 36%, 53%, and 72%, respectively). During the course of anticoagulant therapy (mean duration, 139 days), the rate of thromboembolic recurrences was similar to the rate of major bleeding in patients with breast (5.6 [95% confidence interval (CI), 3.8-8.1] vs 4.1 [95% CI, 2.7-5.9] events per 100 patient-years) or colorectal cancer (10 [95% CI, 7.6-13] vs 12 [95% CI, 9.4-15] per 100 patient-years). In contrast, in patients with prostate cancer, the rate of venous thromboembolic recurrences was half the rate of major bleeding (6.9 [95% CI, 4.4-10] vs 13 [95% CI, 9.2-17] events per 100 patient-years), whereas in those with lung cancer, the rate of thromboembolic recurrences was twofold higher than the rate of major bleeding (27 [95% CI, 22-23] vs 11 [95% CI, 8.6-15] per 100 patient-years). CONCLUSIONS: Significant differences in the clinical profile of venous thromboembolic-related outcomes were observed according to the site of cancer. These findings suggest the development of cancer-specific anticoagulant strategies as an area for further research.

BACKGROUND: Body weight is associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) risk and survival, but to the authors' knowledge, the impact of long-term postdiagnostic weight change is unclear. Herein, the authors investigated whether weight change over the 5 years after a diagnosis of CRC is associated with survival. METHODS: CRC cases diagnosed from 1997 to 2008 were identified through 4 population-based cancer registry sites. Participants enrolled within 2 years of diagnosis and reported their height and weight 2 years prior. Follow-up questionnaires were administered approximately 5 years after diagnosis. Associations between change in weight (in kg) or body mass index (BMI) with overall and CRC-specific survival were estimated using Cox regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of disease, baseline BMI, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, smoking, time between diagnosis and enrollment, and study site. RESULTS: At the 5-year postdiagnostic survey, 2049 participants reported higher (53%; median plus 5 kg), unchanged (12%), or lower (35%; median -4 kg) weight. Over a median of 5.1 years of subsequent follow-up (range, 0.3-9.9 years), 344 participants died (91 of CRC). Long-term weight loss (per 5 kg) was found to be associated with poorer overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-1.21) and CRC-specific survival (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.39). Significantly lower survival was similarly observed for relative weight loss (>5% vs </=5% change), BMI reduction (per 1 unit), or BMI category change (overweight to normal vs remaining overweight). CONCLUSIONS: Weight loss 5 years after a diagnosis of CRC was found to be significantly associated with decreased long-term survival, suggesting the importance of avoiding weight loss in survivors of CRC. Future research should attempt to further evaluate this association, accounting for whether this weight change was intentional or represents a marker of declining health. Cancer 2017;123:4701-4708.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents and young adults with cancer have inferior survival outcomes compared with younger pediatric patients and older adult patients. Lack of insurance may partly explain this disparity. The objective of this study was to identify associations between insurance status and both advanced-stage cancer and cancer-specific mortality. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 18 registries, 57,981 patients ages 15 to 39 years were identified who were diagnosed between 2007 and 2010 and had complete insurance and staging information. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to identify associations between insurance type and disease stage, with the models adjusted for sex, age, and race. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS: Overall, 84% of patients were aged >/= 25 years, 64% were women, and 79% were privately insured. Compared with patients who had private insurance, those who had nonprivate insurance tended to present with more advanced-stage disease and to die more quickly and more commonly from their cancer. Patients ages 25 to 39 years who had Medicaid coverage or no insurance had 3.2 times and 2.4 times higher odds of having stage IV disease, respectively, than privately insured patients (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0-3.5 times higher odds and 2.1-2.6 times higher odds, respectively). Among those with stage I/II and III/IV cancers, the risk of death was 2.9 times greater (95% CI, 2.2-3.9 times greater) and 1.7 times greater (95% CI, 1.5-1.9 times greater), respectively, than the risk for privately insured patients. Patients who died from stage III/IV cancers survived at least 2 months longer if they had private insurance. CONCLUSIONS: Among young adults, insurance status is independently associated with advanced-stage cancer and the risk of death from cancer, even for patients who have low-stage disease. Broader insurance coverage and access to health care may improve some of the disparate outcomes of adolescents and young adults with cancer.

The National Central Cancer Registry of China (NCCR) was the only available source of cancer monitoring in China, even though only about 70% of cancer registration sites were qualified by now. In this study, based on a national large prospective cohort-the China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB), we aimed to provide additional cancer statistics and compare the difference of cancer burden between urban and rural areas of China. A total of 497,693 cancer-free participants aged 35-74 years were recruited and successfully followed up from 2004 to 2013 in 5 urban and 5 rural areas across China. Except for traditional registration systems, the national health insurance system and active follow-up were used to determine new cancer incidents and related deaths. The mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) was used to compare the differences of cancer burden between urban and rural areas of China. We found that cancer mortality coincided well between our cohort and NCCR, while the incidence was much higher in our cohort. Based on CKB, we found the MIR of all cancers was 0.54 in rural areas, which was approximately one-third higher than that in urban areas with 0.39. Cancer profiles in urban areas were transiting to Western distributions, which were characterized with high incidences of breast cancer and colorectal cancer; while cancers of the esophagus, liver and cervix uteri were still common in rural areas of China. Our results provide additional cancer statistics of China and demonstrate the differences of cancer burden between urban and rural areas of China.

Cancer is the leading cause of death in women of reproductive age. During the last decades and especially in developed countries, the incidence of cancer is increasing dramatically, with an incidence of 1 in 1,000 pregnancies. This is mostly related to delay of pregnancy into the late reproductive years. The aim of this study was to investigate the outcome of pregnancy in women with diagnosis of cancer; in particular, neonatal morbidity and mortality, after in utero exposure to chemotherapy, were evaluated. A total of 59 singletons and one twin pregnancy complicated by cancer were followed at our tertiary centre over the last 15 years. A different treatment, based on surgery and/or chemotherapy in pregnancy or delayed to the postpartum period, was employed. There were 59 live births (97%), one foetal loss and one stillbirth at 28 weeks. The congenital malformation rate was 5% (n = 3). The rate of preterm birth was 83%. The mean birthweight and mean birthweight percentile were 2,098 g (740-3930) and 46 (7-93), respectively; 32% of neonates were small for gestational age (SGA). Dividing the population into treated or untreated with chemotherapy, the rate of SGA was not statistically significant different between the two groups. Our results showed that chemotherapy administered during the second trimester or later did not influence intrauterine foetal growth, but the high prevalence of SGA neonates in the two groups, exposed or not exposed to chemotherapy, suggests an influence of maternal cancer per se on foetal growth.

Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a leading cause of end-stage kidney disease nowadays. Certain cancers are more common in patients with diabetes mellitus. However, there are no data concerning the cancer pattern in patients with DN. The aim of this study is to investigate the site-specific cancer risk and mortality in these patients.A retrospective cohort study of 5643 DN patients between 2000 and 2015 was conducted in 2 large hospitals in Hong Kong. Incidence and mortality of various cancers were compared with those of general population using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) respectively.With 24,726 person-years follow-up, 250 cancers were diagnosed. Overall cancer incidence was similar between DN patients and the general population (SIR 1.05, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92-1.19). However, certain site-specific cancers are increased in DN patients: the highest risk was observed for laryngeal cancer (SIR 3.03, 95% CI 1.11-6.60), followed by cancers of liver (SIR 1.96, 95% CI 1.35-2.76) and colorectum (SIR 1.92, 95% CI 1.53-2.37), but the risk of prostate cancer was lower (SIR 0.48, 95% CI 0.21-0.95) in the males with DN. The SMR of all cancers was 1.17 (95% CI 1.01-1.37). For individual specific site, only colorectal cancer carried a significant higher mortality risk (SMR 2.45, 95% CI 1.82-3.23).Our data suggested that DN is associated with increased incidence of cancers of colorectum, liver, and larynx but decreased incidence of prostate cancer. Moreover, there is increased mortality of colorectal cancer in patients with DN.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to clarify the communication preferences of patients with advanced cancer regarding discussions about ending anticancer treatment and transitioning to palliative care and to explore the variables associated with those preferences. METHODS: Participants were 106 Japanese patients with cancer who had been informed at least 1 week earlier about the cessation of their anticancer treatment. They completed a survey measuring their preferences for communication about ending anticancer treatment and transitioning to palliative care as well as their demographic characteristics. Medical records were also examined to investigate medical characteristics. RESULTS: Results of the descriptive analysis indicated that patients strongly preferred their physicians to listen to their distress and concerns (96%), to assure them that their painful symptoms would be controlled (97.1%), and to explain the status of their illness and the physical symptoms that would likely occur in the future (95.1%). Multiple regression analyses identified the factors associated with these preferences: telling patients to prepare mentally and informing them of their expected life expectancy were associated with cancer site; sustaining hope was associated with cancer site and children; and empathic paternalism was associated with duration since cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of patients preferred their physicians to be realistic about their likely future and wanted to be reassured that their painful symptoms would be controlled. For patients with cancer at certain sites, those with children, and those more recently diagnosed, physicians should communicate carefully and actively by providing information on life expectancy and mental preparation, sustaining hope, and behaving with empathic paternalism.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The existence of other primary tumors during the treatment and management of gastric cancer (GC) is an important issue. The present study investigated the prevalence and management of synchronous colorectal neoplasms (CRN) in surgically treated GC patients. METHODS: Of 381 surgically treated GC patients, 332 (87.1%) underwent colonoscopy to detect CRN before surgery or within a year after surgery. RESULTS: CRN were synchronously observed in 140 patients (42.2%). Adenoma was observed in 131 patients (39.4%). Endoscopic resection was done in 18 patients with adenoma. Colorectal cancer (CRC) was observed in 16 patients (4.8%), superficial CRC in 13 and advanced CRC in three patients. Endoscopic resection of superficial CRC was carried out in seven patients, whereas simultaneous surgical resection of CRC was done in nine patients. CRN were more frequently observed in men. CRC was more frequently observed in GC patients with distant metastasis, albeit without significance. The overall survival of GC patients with CRN or CRC was poorer than that of patients without CRN or CRC. CONCLUSION: Synchronous CRN were commonly associated with GC and screening colonoscopy should be offered to patients with GC.

BACKGROUND: Routine screening for problematic symptoms is emerging as a best practice in cancer systems globally. The objective of this observational study was to assess the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) computerized adaptive testing (CAT) for fatigue and sleep-disturbance items compared with legacy measures in routine ambulatory cancer care. METHODS: Patients who attended outpatient clinics at the Princess Margaret Cancer Center completed PROMIS CAT item banks and legacy measures (the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy [FACIT]-Fatigue scale and the Insomnia Severity Index [ISI]) using tablet computers during clinic visits. The completion rates, patient acceptability, and diagnostic accuracy of PROMIS CAT were evaluated against legacy measures using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: Participants consisted of 336 patients (mean age +/- standard deviation, 57.4 +/- 15.7 years; 55% females; 75% Caucasian). Over 98% of patients did not find symptom screening was burdensome, although only 65% were willing to complete the survey at every visit. PROMIS CAT scores were significantly correlated with both FACIT-Fatigue scores (r = -0.83) and ISI scores (r = -0.57; p < 0.0001 for all). Areas under the curve (AUC) by ROC analysis for fatigue were 0.946 using the FACIT-Fatigue cutoff </=30, 0.910 for sleep disturbance, and 0.922 for sleep impairment using the ISI cutoff >/=15. The recommended T-score cut-off for PROMIS CAT Fatigue was 57, Sleep Disturbance was 57, and Sleep Impairment was 57. CONCLUSIONS: The current results support the feasibility and accuracy of PROMIS CAT and its potential for use in routine ambulatory cancer care. Future research will assess feedback of these data to clinicians and evaluate effects on earlier identification of and intervention for these problems. Cancer 2016. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The discovery of oncogenic drivers has ushered in a new era for lung cancer, but the role of these mutations in different racial/ethnic minorities has been understudied. The Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium 1 (LCMC1) database was investigated to evaluate the frequency and impact of oncogenic drivers in lung adenocarcinomas in the racial/ethnic minority patient population. METHODS: Patients with metastatic lung adenocarcinomas from 14 US sites were enrolled in the LCMC1. Tumor samples were collected from 2009 through 2012 with multiplex genotyping performed on 10 oncogenic drivers (KRAS, epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR], anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements, ERBB2 [formerly human epidermal growth factor receptor 2], BRAF, PIK3CA, MET amplification, NRAS, MEK1, and AKT1). Patients were classified as white, Asian, African American (AA), or Latino. The driver mutation frequency, the treatments, and the survival from diagnosis were determined. RESULTS: One thousand seven patients were included. Whites represented the majority (n = 838); there were 60 AAs, 48 Asians, and 28 Latinos. Asian patients had the highest rate of oncogenic drivers with 81% (n = 39), and they were followed by Latinos with 68% (n = 19), whites with 61% (n = 511), and AAs with 53% (n = 32). For AAs, the EGFR mutation frequency was 22%, the KRAS frequency was 17%, and the ALK frequency was 4%. Asian patients were most likely to receive targeted therapies (51% vs 27% for AAs). There were no significant differences in overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: Differences were observed in the prevalence of oncogenic drivers in lung adenocarcinomas and in subsequent treatments among racial groups. The lowest frequency of drivers was seen for AA patients; however, more than half of AA patients had a driver, and those treated with targeted therapy had outcomes similar to those of other races.

BACKGROUND: Due to the complexity of diagnosis and treatment, care for children and young adolescents with cancer preferably occurs in specialised paediatric oncology centres with potentially better cure rates and minimal late effects. This study assessed where children with cancer in the Netherlands were treated since 2004. METHODS: All patients aged under 18 diagnosed with cancer between 2004 and 2013 were selected from the Netherlands Cancer Registry (NCR) and linked with the Dutch Childhood Oncology Group (DCOG) database. Associations between patient and tumour characteristics and site of care were tested statistically with logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: This population-based study of 6021 children diagnosed with cancer showed that 82% of them were treated in a paediatric oncology centre. Ninety-four percent of the patients under 10 years of age, 85% of the patients aged 10-14 and 48% of the patients aged 15-17 were treated in a paediatric oncology centre. All International Classification of Childhood Cancers (ICCC), 3rd edition, ICCC-3 categories, except embryonal tumours, were associated with a higher risk of treatment outside a paediatric oncology centre compared to leukaemia. Multivariable analyses by ICCC-3 category revealed that specific tumour types such as chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML), embryonal carcinomas, bone tumours other type than osteosarcoma, non-rhabdomyosarcomas, thyroid carcinomas, melanomas and skin carcinomas as well as lower-staged tumours were associated with treatment outside a paediatric oncology centre. CONCLUSION: The site of childhood cancer care in the Netherlands depends on the age of the cancer patient, type of tumour and stage at diagnosis. Collaboration between paediatric oncology centre(s), other academic units is needed to ensure most up-to-date paediatric cancer care for childhood cancer patients at the short and long term.

BACKGROUND: Although race is associated with prostate cancer progression in early stage disease, once men have advanced disease, it is unclear whether race continues to predict a poor outcome. The authors hypothesized that, in an equal-access setting among patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) and no known metastases (M0/Mx), black men would receive imaging tests at similar rates as nonblack men (ie, there would be an equal opportunity to detect metastases) but would have a higher risk of metastatic disease. METHODS: In total, 837 men who were diagnosed with M0/Mx CRPC during 2000 through 2014 from 5 Veterans Affairs hospitals in the SEARCH (Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital) database were analyzed. Data on all imaging tests after CRPC diagnosis were collected, including date, type, and outcome. Multivariable Cox models were used to test associations between race and the time to first metastasis, first bone metastasis, first bone scan, second bone scan among men who had a negative first bone scan, and overall survival. RESULTS: Black men (n = 306) were equally as likely as nonblack men (n = 531) to receive a first and second bone scan after a diagnosis of CRPC. There were no significant differences in the risk of developing any metastases, bone metastases, time to bone scans, or overall survival between black men and nonblack men (all P > .2). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of racial differences in the development of metastases and scanning practices observed in this study suggests that, once men have a diagnosis of M0/Mx CRPC, race may not be a prognostic factor. Efforts to understand prostate cancer racial disparities may derive greater benefit by focusing on the risk of developing prostate cancer and on the outcomes of men who have early stage disease.

Mammary ductoscopy (MD) is commonly used to detect intraductal lesions associated with nipple discharge. This study investigated the relationships between ductoscopic image-based indicators and breast cancer risk, and developed a nomogram for evaluating breast cancer risk in intraductal neoplasms with nipple discharge. A total of 879 consecutive inpatients (916 breasts) with nipple discharge who underwent selective duct excision for intraductal neoplasms detected by MD from June 2008 to April 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. A nomogram was developed using a multivariate logistic regression model based on data from a training set (687 cases) and validated in an independent validation set (229 cases). A Youden-derived cut-off value was assigned to the nomogram for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Color of discharge, location, appearance, and surface of neoplasm, and morphology of ductal wall were independent predictors for breast cancer in multivariate logistic regression analysis. A nomogram based on these predictors performed well. The P value of the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for the prediction model was 0.36. Area under the curve values of 0.812 (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.763-0.860) and 0.738 (95 % CI 0.635-0.841) was obtained in the training and validation sets, respectively. The accuracies of the nomogram for breast cancer diagnosis were 71.2 % in the training set and 75.5 % in the validation set. We developed a nomogram for evaluating breast cancer risk in intraductal neoplasms with nipple discharge based on MD image findings. This model may aid individual risk assessment and guide treatment in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Most parents of children with cancer say they want detailed information about their child's prognosis. However, prior work has been conducted in populations of limited diversity. The authors sought to evaluate the impact of parental race/ethnicity on prognosis communication experiences among parents of children with cancer. METHODS: In total, 357 parents of children with cancer and the children's physicians were surveyed at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute/Boston Children's Hospital and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Outcome measures were parental preferences for prognostic information, physician beliefs about parental preferences, prognosis communication processes, and communication outcomes. Associations were assessed by logistic regression with generalized estimating equations to correct for physician clustering. RESULTS: Two hundred eighty-one parents (79%) were white, 23 (6%) were black, 29 (8%) were Hispanic, and 24 (7%) were Asian/other. Eighty-seven percent of parents wanted as much detail as possible about their child's prognosis, with no significant differences by race/ethnicity (P = .75). However, physician beliefs about parental preferences for prognosis communication varied based on parent race/ethnicity, with physicians considering black and Hispanic parents less interested in details about prognosis than whites (P = .003). Accurate understanding of a less favorable prognosis was greater among white (49%) versus nonwhite parents (range, 20%-29%), although this difference was not statistically significant (P = .14). CONCLUSIONS: Most parents, regardless of racial and ethnic background, want detailed prognostic information about their child's cancer. However, physicians underestimate the information needs of black and Hispanic parents. To meet parents' information needs, physicians should ask about parents' information preferences before prognosis discussions. Cancer 2017;123:3995-4003. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

Background and Aims: The association between inflammatory bowel disease [IBD] and cancer remains poorly defined in Asian populations. Therefore, we conducted a nationwide population-based study to determine the cancer risk in Korean patients with IBD. Methods: Using the National Health Insurance claims data, we collected data on patients diagnosed with IBD (5595 Crohn's disease [CD] and 10 049 ulcerative colitis [UC]) from 2011 to 2014. Standardized incidence ratios [SIRs] of overall and site-specific cancers in IBD patients in comparison with the general population were calculated. Results: The overall cancer risk was higher in CD patients [SIR, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-3.0 in men and 3.3; 2.4-4.5 in women] and UC patients [1.9; 1.6-2.3 in men and 1.9; 1.5-2.4 in women]. There were significantly increased risks for the following cancers: small bowel cancer [31.2; 3.8-112.8], colorectal cancer [CRC] [3.7; 1.6-7.2] and haematological cancer [4.0; 1.1-10.3] in men with CD; small bowel cancer [61.1; 7.4-220.6], CRC [4.7; 1.5-10.9], liver cancer [15.3; 5.6-33.2], pancreatic cancer [8.6; 1.0-31.0] and haematological cancer [11.0; 3.6-25.7] in women with CD; CRC [2.1; 1.3-3.3] and cancer of the prostate [3.5; 2.1-5.5], brain/central nervous system [6.1; 1.3-17.9] and thyroid [2.2; 1.1-3.9] in men with UC; and CRC [3.0; 1.5-5.3], cancer of the liver [4.4; 1.6-9.7] and cervix uteri [5.7; 2.4-11.1], and haematological cancer [3.5; 1.1-8.1] in women with UC. Women with CD had an increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL] and leukaemia. Women with UC had an increased risk of NHL. Conclusions: Korean patients with IBD are at increased risk for overall, intestinal and haematological cancer.

OBJECTIVES: The purposes were to investigate the health status of elderly cancer patients by comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) and to compare the complications with respect to baseline CGA and to evaluate the need for geriatric interventions in an elderly cancer patients' population. MATERIAL: Patients aged >/=70 years with lung cancer (LC), cancer of the head and neck (HNC), colorectal cancer (CRC), or upper gastro-intestinal cancer (UGIC) are referred to the Department of Oncology for cancer treatment. METHODS: CGA was performed prior to cancer treatment and addressed the following domains: Activities of daily living (ADL), instrumental ADL (IADL), comorbidity, polypharmacy, nutrition, cognition, and depression. Complications, defined as dose reduction and discontinuation of treatment due to grade 3-4 toxicity, hospital admission, shift to palliative treatment, or death within 90 days, were identified from the medical files. Patients were classified as fit, vulnerable, or frail by CGA. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Patients (N = 217) with a median age of 75 years (range: 70-93 yeas) were included: 13% were fit, 35% vulnerable, and 52% frail. CGA significantly predicted admittance to hospital in frail and vulnerable patients compared to fit patients: risk ratio (RR) 2.12 (95% CI: 1.01; 4.46). Vulnerable and frail patients had higher absolute risk of death within 90 days compared to fit patients: 7% and 23% versus 0%. HR for death within 90 days in frail patients as compared to vulnerable patients was 3.50 (95% CI: 1.34; 9.15). More frail patients (88%) needed geriatric interventions than the vulnerable (46%) and fit patients (32%). Major conclusion: Few elderly cancer patients seem to be fit. CGA predicts admittance to hospital in a population of elderly patients with mixed cancer diseases. Frail and vulnerable patients have higher risk of death within 90 days as compared to fit patients.

BACKGROUND & AIMS: Many patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma carry germline mutations associated with increased risk of cancer. It is not clear whether patients with intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), which are precursors to some pancreatic cancers, also carry these mutations. We assessed the prevalence of germline mutations associated with cancer risk in patients with histologically confirmed IPMN. METHODS: We obtained nontumor tissue samples from 315 patients with surgically resected IPMNs from 1997 through 2017, and we sequenced 94 genes with variants associated with cancer risk. Mutations associated with increased risk of cancer were identified and compared with individuals from the Exome Aggregation Consortium. RESULTS: We identified 23 patients with a germline mutation associated with cancer risk (7.3%; 95% confidence interval, 4.9-10.8). Nine patients had a germline mutation associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility (2.9%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-5.4). More patients with IPMNs carried germline mutations in ATM (P < .0001), PTCH1 (P < .0001), and SUFU (P < .0001) compared with controls. Patients with IPMNs and germline mutations associated with pancreatic cancer were more like to have concurrent invasive pancreatic carcinoma compared with patients with IPMNs without these mutations (P < .0320). CONCLUSIONS: In sequence analyses of 315 patients with surgically resected IPMNs, we found that almost 3% to carry mutations associated with pancreatic cancer risk. More patients with IPMNs and germline mutations associated with pancreatic cancer had concurrent invasive pancreatic carcinoma compared with patients with IPMNs without these mutations. Genetic analysis of patients with IPMNs might identify those at greatest risk for cancer.

The number of cancer survivors continues to increase because of both advances in early detection and treatment and the aging and growth of the population. For the public health community to better serve these survivors, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute collaborate to estimate the number of current and future cancer survivors using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries. In addition, current treatment patterns for the most prevalent cancer types are presented based on information in the National Cancer Data Base and treatment-related side effects are briefly described. More than 15.5 million Americans with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2016, and this number is projected to reach more than 20 million by January 1, 2026. The 3 most prevalent cancers are prostate (3,306,760), colon and rectum (724,690), and melanoma (614,460) among males and breast (3,560,570), uterine corpus (757,190), and colon and rectum (727,350) among females. More than one-half (56%) of survivors were diagnosed within the past 10 years, and almost one-half (47%) are aged 70 years or older. People with a history of cancer have unique medical and psychosocial needs that require proactive assessment and management by primary care providers. Although there are a growing number of tools that can assist patients, caregivers, and clinicians in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship, further evidence-based resources are needed to optimize care.

This research examines a model of how personality (Five-Factor Model) is related to adjustment to cancer in later life in terms of the presence of continuing cancer-related worry and depression among older adult, long-term cancer survivors. Data from an NCI-funded study with 275 older adult (age 60+), long-term (5+ years) survivors of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer were examined. Regression analyses identified neuroticism as the strongest predictor of cancer-related worry along with continuing cancer-related symptoms. For depression, three personality dimensions (neuroticism, conscientiousness, and agreeableness) were significant predictors. Findings suggest the importance of considering the central role that survivors' personality characteristics play in understanding cancer-related worries and depression. Understanding these dispositional characteristics is key for social workers and health-care practitioners in counseling survivors experiencing these common mental health effects.

BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, there are currently no standardized measures of tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure in patients diagnosed with cancer, and this gap hinders the conduct of studies examining the impact of tobacco on cancer treatment outcomes. The objective of the current study was to evaluate and refine questionnaire items proposed by an expert task force to assess tobacco use. METHODS: Trained interviewers conducted cognitive testing with cancer patients aged >/=21 years with a history of tobacco use and a cancer diagnosis of any stage and organ site who were recruited at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. Iterative rounds of testing and item modification were conducted to identify and resolve cognitive issues (comprehension, memory retrieval, decision/judgment, and response mapping) and instrument navigation issues until no items warranted further significant modification. RESULTS: Thirty participants (6 current cigarette smokers, 1 current cigar smoker, and 23 former cigarette smokers) were enrolled from September 2014 to February 2015. The majority of items functioned well. However, qualitative testing identified wording ambiguities related to cancer diagnosis and treatment trajectory, such as "treatment" and "surgery"; difficulties with lifetime recall; errors in estimating quantities; and difficulties with instrument navigation. Revisions to item wording, format, order, response options, and instructions resulted in a questionnaire that demonstrated navigational ease as well as good question comprehension and response accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: The Cancer Patient Tobacco Use Questionnaire (C-TUQ) can be used as a standardized item set to accelerate the investigation of tobacco use in the cancer setting. Cancer 2016;122:1728-34.

BACKGROUND: Because of the current epidemic of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oropharyngeal cancer (OPC), a screening strategy is urgently needed. The presence of serum antibodies to HPV-16 early (E) antigens is associated with an increased risk for OPC. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of antibodies to a panel of HPV-16 E antigens in screening for OPC. METHODS: This case-control study included 378 patients with OPC, 153 patients with nonoropharyngeal head and neck cancer (non-OPC), and 782 healthy control subjects. The tumor HPV status was determined with p16 immunohistochemistry and HPV in situ hybridization. HPV-16 E antibody levels in serum were identified with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A trained binary logistic regression model based on the combination of all E antigens was predefined and applied to the data set. The sensitivity and specificity of the assay for distinguishing HPV-related OPC from controls were calculated. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals for the association of head and neck cancer with the antibody status. RESULTS: Of the 378 patients with OPC, 348 had p16-positive OPC. HPV-16 E antibody levels were significantly higher among patients with p16-positive OPC but not among patients with non-OPC or among controls. Serology showed high sensitivity and specificity for HPV-related OPC (binary classifier: 83% sensitivity and 99% specificity for p16-positive OPC). CONCLUSIONS: A trained binary classification algorithm that incorporates information about multiple E antibodies has high sensitivity and specificity and may be advantageous for risk stratification in future screening trials.

BACKGROUND: Multiple BAP1 negative melanocytic neoplasms are a hallmark of familial cancer susceptibility syndrome caused by BAP1 germline mutation. The syndrome is characterized by increased incidence of renal cell carcinoma, mesothelioma, cholangiocarcinoma, cutaneous and uveal melanoma and some other neoplasms. METHODS: We report histomorphologic characteristics of six cutaneous melanocytic neoplasms with loss of BAP1 expression in two members of a family with BAP1-associated cancer susceptibility syndrome. RESULTS: The neoplasms were dermal melanocytic nevi characterized by a proliferation of large epithelioid (spitzoid) melanocytes, and adipocytic metaplasia. Nuclear pseudoinclusions and multinucleated melanocytes were present in most neoplasms. In two of the cases, a nodular melanoma was found associated with a dermal nevus. None of the melanomas recurred or metastasized after 6 and 3 years of follow up. CONCLUSIONS: We report two new cases of melanoma arising in a BAP1-deficient melanocytic nevus in the setting of familial tumor predisposition syndrome. Adipocytic metaplasia and nuclear pseudoinclusions may be additional morphologic clues to a BAP1-deficient nevus. It remains to be seen whether these features are more common in familial than sporadic lesions.

BACKGROUND: Accountable care organizations (ACOs) were established to improve care and outcomes for beneficiaries requiring highly coordinated, complex care. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between hospital ACO participation and the outcomes of major surgical oncology procedures. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of Medicare beneficiaries older than 65 years who were undergoing a major surgical resection for colorectal, bladder, esophageal, kidney, liver, ovarian, pancreatic, lung, or prostate cancer from 2011 through 2013. A difference-in-differences analysis was implemented to compare the postimplementation period (January 2013 through December 2013) with the baseline period (January 2011 through December 2012) to assess the impact of hospital ACO participation on 30-day mortality, complications, readmissions, and length of stay (LOS). RESULTS: Among 384,519 patients undergoing major cancer surgery at 106 ACO hospitals and 2561 control hospitals, this study found a 30-day mortality rate of 3.4%, a readmission rate of 12.5%, a complication rate of 43.8%, and a prolonged LOS rate of 10.0% in control hospitals and similar rates in ACO hospitals. Secular trends were noted, with reductions in perioperative adverse events in control hospitals between the baseline and postimplementation periods: mortality (percentage-point reduction, 0.1%; P = .19), readmissions (percentage-point reduction, 0.4%; P = .001), complications (percentage-point reduction, 1.0%; P < .001), and prolonged LOS (percentage-point reduction, 1.1%; P < .001). After accounting for these secular trends, this study identified no significant effect of hospital participation in an ACO on the frequency of perioperative outcomes (difference-in-differences estimator P values, .24-.72). CONCLUSIONS: Early hospital participation in the Medicare Shared Savings Program ACO program was not associated with greater reductions in adverse perioperative outcomes for patients undergoing major cancer surgery in comparison with control hospitals.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer (OPC) and a subset of oral cavity cancer (OCC) is increasing in the United States. To the authors' knowledge, the presumed growing prevalence of survivors of OPC and OCC has not been investigated to date. METHODS: Retrospective analysis of Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data (1975-2012) estimated changes in incidence, 5-year cause-specific survival, and prevalence for OPC and OCC. Changes in incidence, cause-specific survival and prevalence were estimated by linear regression and expressed as the percentage change (B). Differences in incidence trends over time were determined by joinpoint analysis. RESULTS: The incidence of OPC increased by 62.6% from 1975 through 2012. Notable increases in OPC incidence were observed among men, white individuals, and those of younger ages. The 5-year survival for OPC increased significantly for all sexes, races, and individuals aged >30 years, with white individuals and males experiencing the largest increase in survival. By contrast, the incidence of OCC declined by 22.3% during the same time period. OCC incidence decreased across all groups but increased among individuals aged 30 to 39 years. Significant increases in survival were observed for OCC, except for those who were female, black, and aged <40 years. The prevalence of survivors of OPC increased from 2000 to 2012 (B, 115.1 per 100,000 individuals per year; P<.0001), whereas the prevalence of survivors of OCC significantly decreased (B, -15.8 per 100,000 individuals per year; P<.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of survivors of OPC is increasing, whereas the prevalence of survivors of OCC is declining. These data portend significant implications for long-term care planning for survivors of OPC and OCC. Cancer 2016;122:1380-1387. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: States routinely may consider rollbacks of Medicaid expansions to address statewide economic conditions. To the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the effects of public insurance contractions on health outcomes. The current study examined the effects of the 2005 Medicaid disenrollment in Tennessee on breast cancer stage at the time of diagnosis and delays in treatment among nonelderly women. METHODS: The authors used Tennessee Cancer Registry data from 2002 through 2008 and estimated a difference-in-difference model comparing women diagnosed with breast cancer who lived in low-income zip codes (and therefore were more likely to be subject to disenrollment) with a similar group of women who lived in high-income zip codes before and after the 2005 Medicaid disenrollment. The study outcomes were changes in stage of disease at the time of diagnosis and delays in treatment of >60 days and >90 days. RESULTS: Overall, nonelderly women in Tennessee were diagnosed at later stages of disease and experienced more delays in treatment in the period after disenrollment. Disenrollment was found to be associated with a 3.3-percentage point increase in late stage of disease at the time of diagnosis (P = .024), a 1.9-percentage point decrease in having a delay of >60 days in surgery (P = .024), and a 1.4-percentage point decrease in having a delay of >90 days in treatment (P = .054) for women living in low-income zip codes compared with women residing in high-income zip codes. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study indicate that Medicaid disenrollment is associated with a later stage of disease at the time of breast cancer diagnosis, thereby providing evidence of the potential negative health impacts of Medicaid contractions.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer 2 (BRCA2)-associated breast and ovarian cancers are sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy. It is unknown whether BRCA2-associated prostate cancer responds favorably to such treatment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a single-institution cohort of men with castration-resistant, metastatic prostate cancer was performed to determine the association between carrier status of pathogenic BRCA2 germline variants and prostate-specific antigen response to carboplatin-based chemotherapy. From 2001 through 2015, 8081 adult men with prostate cancer who had a consultation and/or underwent treatment at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute provided blood samples and consented to analyses of biologic material and clinical records. A subgroup of 141 men received at least 2 doses of carboplatin and docetaxel for castration-resistant disease (94% were also taxane refractory). These patients were categorized according to the absence or presence of pathogenic germline mutations in BRCA2 based on DNA sequencing from whole blood. The primary outcome was the response rate to carboplatin/docetaxel chemotherapy, defined according to a decline in prostate-specific antigen that exceeded 50% within 12 weeks of initiating this regimen. Associations between BRCA2 mutation status and response to carboplatin-based chemotherapy were tested using the Fisher exact test, with a 2-sided P value < .05 as the threshold for significance. RESULTS: Pathogenic germline BRCA2 variants were observed in 8 of 141 men (5.7%; 95% confidence interval, 2.5%-10.9%). Six of 8 BRCA2 carriers (75%) experienced prostate-specific antigen declines >50% within 12 weeks, compared with 23 of 133 noncarriers (17%; absolute difference, 58%; 95% confidence interval, 27%-88%; P < .001). Prostate cancer cell lines functionally corroborated these clinical findings. CONCLUSIONS: BRCA2-associated, castration-resistant prostate cancer is associated with a higher likelihood of response to carboplatin-based chemotherapy than non-BRCA2-associated prostate cancer.

We present and discuss recent data on the frequency of cancer in France and on cancer survival. In the male population, the incidence of prostate and head and neck cancers diminishes rapidly and the incidence of the other common cancers: lung and colorectal diminishes less markedly; cancer mortality decreases for most sites. In the female population, the incidence of breast cancer diminishes rapidly, the incidence of colorectal and uterus cancers diminish less markedly and the incidence of lung cancer increases very fast: the mortality trends are similar. Cancer survival has improved in the last 16 years but some of the improvements are an artifact induced by overdiagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Currently, little information is available on childhood cancer incidence rates in Eastern Asia. The objective of this study was to report the first population-based cancer surveillance of children and adolescents in Taiwan. METHODS: Data from the Taiwan Cancer Registry were examined for cancer frequencies and incidence rates among individuals ages birth to 19 years from 1995 to 2009. Types of cancers were grouped according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer. Rates were compared by sex and age. For further comparisons with other countries, rates were age standardized to the 2000 world standard population in 5-year age groups. Trends in incidence rates also were evaluated. RESULTS: In total, 12,315 individuals were diagnosed with childhood cancers, for an age-standardized incidence rate (ASR) of 132.1 per million person-years from 1995 to 2009. The male-to-female incidence rate ratio was 1.19. Overall, leukemias were the most common cancer (ASR, 39.1 per million person-years), followed by central nervous system neoplasms (15.8 per million person-years), and lymphomas (15.3 per million person-years). During the 15-year study period, the incidence rates increased by 1% annually. Compared with other countries, the rate of hepatic tumors was 2 times greater in Taiwan. The rate of germ cell neoplasms in Taiwan was similar to that in the United States and was 1.3 to 1.9 times greater compared with Canada, Brazil, Israel, and Japan. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the current data, the observed increase in overall incidence rates was attributable only marginally to improvements in case ascertainment and diagnostic procedures. The high rates of malignant hepatic tumors and germ cell neoplasms in Taiwan suggest variations in the background risk factors.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Brain metastases commonly occur in patients with malignant skin, lung and breast cancers resulting in high morbidity and poor prognosis. Integrins containing an alphav subunit are cell adhesion proteins that contribute to cancer cell migration and cancer progression. We hypothesized that high expression of alphav integrin cell adhesion protein promoted metastatic phenotypes in cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer cells from different origins were used and studied regarding their metastatic ability and intetumumab, anti-alphav integrin mAb, sensitivity using in vitro cell migration assay and in vivo brain metastases animal models. RESULTS: The number of brain metastases and the rate of occurrence were positively correlated with cancer cell alphav integrin levels. High alphav integrin-expressing cancer cells showed significantly faster cell migration rate in vitro than low alphav integrin-expressing cells. Intetumumab significantly inhibited cancer cell migration in vitro regardless of alphav integrin expression level. Overexpression of alphav integrin in cancer cells with low alphav integrin level accelerated cell migration in vitro and increased the occurrence of brain metastases in vivo. CONCLUSION: alphav integrin promotes brain metastases in cancer cells and may mediate early steps in the metastatic cascade, such as adhesion to brain vasculature. Targeting alphav integrin with intetumumab could provide clinical benefit in treating cancer patients who develop metastases.

Obesity is associated with a range of health outcomes that are of clinical and public health significance, including cancer. Herein, we summarize epidemiologic and preclinical evidence for an association between obesity and increased risk of breast and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. Moreover, we describe data from observational studies of weight change in humans and from calorie-restriction studies in mouse models that support a potential role for weight loss in counteracting tumor-promoting properties of obesity in breast and prostate cancers. Given that weight loss is challenging to achieve and maintain, we also consider evidence linking treatments for obesity-associated co-morbidities, including metformin, statins and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with reduced breast and prostate cancer incidence and mortality. Finally, we highlight several challenges that should be considered when conducting epidemiologic and preclinical research in the area of obesity and cancer, including the measurement of obesity in population-based studies, the timing of obesity and weight change in relation to tumor latency and cancer diagnosis, and the heterogeneous nature of obesity and its associated co-morbidities. Given that obesity is a complex trait, comprised of behavioral, epidemiologic and molecular/metabolic factors, we argue that a transdisciplinary approach is the key to understanding the mechanisms linking obesity and cancer. As such, this review highlights the critical need to integrate evidence from both epidemiologic and preclinical studies to gain insight into both biologic and non-biologic mechanisms contributing to the obesity-cancer link.

AIMS: In the absence of clinical data, accurate identification of cost drivers is needed for economic comparison in an alternate payment model. From a health plan perspective using claims data in a commercial population, the objective was to identify and quantify the effects of cost drivers in economic models of breast, lung, and colorectal cancer costs over a 6-month episode following initial chemotherapy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study analyzed claims data from 9,748 Cigna beneficiaries with diagnosis of breast, lung, and colorectal cancer following initial chemotherapy from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2015. We used multivariable regression models to quantify the impact of key factors on cost during the initial 6-month cancer care episode. RESULTS: Metastasis, facility provider affiliation, episode risk group (ERG) risk score, and radiation were cost drivers for all three types of cancer (breast, lung, and colorectal). In addition, younger age (p < .0001) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 oncogene overexpression (HER2+)-directed therapy (p < .0001) were associated with higher costs in breast cancer. Younger age (p < .0001) and female gender (p < .0001) were also associated with higher costs in colorectal cancer. Metastasis was also associated with 50% more hospital admissions and increased hospital length of stay (p < .001) in all three cancers over the 6-month episode duration. Chemotherapy and supportive drug therapies accounted for the highest proportion (48%) of total medical costs among beneficiaries observed. CONCLUSIONS: Value-based reimbursement models in oncology should appropriately account for key cost drivers. Although claims-based methodologies may be further augmented with clinical data, this study recommends adjusting for the factors identified in these models to predict costs in breast, lung, and colorectal cancers.

In the 2 and half decades reviewed (1970-1995), research established that chromosomal translocation, deletion, and DNA amplification are prerequisites to cancerogenesis and that oncogenes, tumor-suppressor genes, growth factors, and cytokines play crucial roles in the pathomechanism of cancer. Human papillomavirus, human immunodeficiency virus, herpes virus, and hepatitis B virus were identified as cancer-causing viruses. Several laboratory tests were developed for the detection of primary and recurrent cancers, and cancer prevention by screening methods was popularized. Sonography, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, excision of sentinel lymph nodes, and immunohistochemical techniques became routine procedures. Clinicopathologic staging and classification of tumors were standardized. Limited surgery, adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemoradiation, and the therapeutic use of monoclonal antibodies, tumor vaccines, and targeted chemotherapy became routine practice. The decline in cancer incidence and mortality demonstrated that cancer prevention and advancement in oncology are pivotal to success in the crusade against cancer. Above all, it was clearly established that the care of patients with cancer can be accomplished best in a multidisciplinary setting involving surgical oncologists, radiologists, radiation therapists, medical oncologists, surgical pathologists, and laboratory scientists. In conclusion, the 25 years from 1970 and 1995 are the high-water mark in clinical oncology, and this is the period when oncology turned from art to science.

Background: This study aimed to examine trends in smoking-related cancer mortality rates and to investigate the effect birth cohort on smoking-related cancer mortality in Korean men. Methods: The number of smoking-related cancer deaths and corresponding population numbers were obtained from Statistics Korea for the period 1984-2013. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to detect changes in trends in age-standardized mortality rates. Birth-cohort specific mortality rates were illustrated by 5 year age groups. Results: The age-standardized mortality rates for oropharyngeal decreased from 2003 to 2013 (annual percent change (APC): -3.1 (95% CI, -4.6 to -1.6)) and lung cancers decreased from 2002 to 2013 (APC -2.4 (95% CI -2.7 to -2.2)). The mortality rates for esophageal declined from 1994 to 2002 (APC -2.5 (95% CI -4.1 to -0.8)) and from 2002 to 2013 (APC -5.2 (95% CI -5.7 to -4.7)) and laryngeal cancer declined from 1995 to 2013 (average annual percent change (AAPC): -3.3 (95% CI -4.7 to -1.8)). By the age group, the trends for the smoking-related cancer mortality except for oropharyngeal cancer have changed earlier to decrease in the younger age group. The birth-cohort specific mortality rates and age-period-cohort analysis consistently showed that all birth cohorts born after 1930 showed reduced mortality of smoking-related cancers. Conclusions: In Korean men, smoking-related cancer mortality rates have decreased. Our findings also indicate that current decreases in smoking-related cancer mortality rates have mainly been due to a decrease in the birth cohort effect, which suggest that decrease in smoking rates.

BACKGROUND: Individual country- and cancer site-specific studies suggest that the age-adjusted incidence of many common cancers has increased in European populations over the past two decades. To quantify the extent of these trends and the recent burden of cancer, here we present a comprehensive overview of trends in population-based incidence of the five common cancers across Europe derived from a new web-based portal of the European cancer registries. METHODS: Data on incidence for cancers of the colon and rectum, prostate, breast, corpus uteri and stomach diagnosed from 1988 to 2008 were obtained from the European Cancer Observatory for cancer registries from 26 countries. Annual age-standardised incidence rates and average annual percentage changes were calculated. RESULTS: Incidence of four common cancers in eastern and central European countries (prostate, postmenopausal breast, corpus uteri and colorectum) started to approach levels in northern and western Europe, where rates were already high in the past but levelled off in some countries in recent years. Decreases in stomach cancer incidence were seen in all countries. DISCUSSION: Increasing trends in incidence of the most common cancers, except stomach cancer, are bad news to public health but can largely be explained by well-known changes in society in the past decades. Thus, current and future efforts in primary cancer prevention should not only remain focussed on the further reduction of smoking but engage in the long-term efforts to retain healthy lifestyles, especially avoiding excess weight through balanced diets and regular physical exercise.

Background: The principal aim of this report was to study second primary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in long-term survivors of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) with regard to the germline genetic background. Patients and methods: A total of 118 PDAC patients after a curative-intent surgery who were treated between 2006 and 2011 were analyzed. Of the 22 patients surviving for >5 years, six went on to develop SMNs. A genetic analysis of 219 hereditary cancer-predisposition and candidate genes was performed by targeted next-generation sequencing in germline DNA from 20 of these patients. Results: Of all the radically resected PDAC patients, six patients went on to subsequently develop SMNs, which accounted for 27% of the long-term survivors. The median time to diagnosis of SMNs, which included two cases of rectal cancer, and one case each of prostate cancer, malignant melanoma, breast cancer, and urinary bladder cancer, was 52.5 months. At the time of analysis, none of these patients had died as a result of PDAC progression. We identified four carriers of germline pathogenic mutations in 20 analyzed long-term survivors. One carrier of the CHEK2 mutation was found among four analyzed patients who developed SMNs. Of the remaining 16 long-term PDAC survivors, 3 patients (19%) carried germline mutation(s) in the MLH1+ ATM, CHEK2, and RAD51D gene, respectively. Conclusion: This retrospective analysis indicates that SMNs in PDAC survivors are an important clinical problem and may be more common than has been acknowledged to be the case. In patients with good performance status, surgical therapy should be considered, as the SMNs often have a favorable prognosis.

Objective: To explore the current status of research on economic burden of cancer in China from 1996 to 2014. Methods: The key words including cancer, economic burden, expenditure, cost were used to retrieve the literatures published in CNKI and Wanfang (the two most commonly used databases for literature in Chinese) and PubMed during 1996-2014. A total of 91 studies were included after several exclusionary procedures. Information on subjects and data source, methodology, main results were structurally abstracted. All the expenditure data were discounted to year of 2013 value using China's health care consumer price indices. Results: More than half of the included studies were published over the past 5 years, 32 of the studies were about lung cancer. Among the 83 individual-based surveys, 77 were hospital-based and obtained data via individually medical record abstraction, and most of which only considered the direct medical expenditure. Expenditure per cancer patient and expenditure per diem were the most commonly used outcome indicators. Majority of the findings on expenditure per cancer patient ranged from 10 thousands to 30 thousands Chinese Yuan (CNY), with larger disparity in lung and breast cancer (ranged from 10 thousands to 90 thousands CNY), narrower difference in esophageal and stomach cancer (ranged from 10 thousands to 50 thousands CNY), and most stable trend in cervical cancer (almost all the values less than 20 thousands CNY). Without exception, the expenditures per diem for all the common cancers were increasing over the period from 1996 to 2014 (3-7 fold increase). Only 8 population-level economic burden studies were included and the reported expenditure of cancer at national level ranged from 32.6 billions to 100.7 billions CNY. Conclusions: Evidence on economic burden of cancer in China from 1996 to 2014 are limited and weakly comparable, particularly at a population level, and the reported expenditure per patient may be underestimated.

BACKGROUND: Patients with resectable esophageal cancer (rEC) are managed with either concurrent chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (CRSx) or concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone (cCR). To the authors' knowledge, there is insufficient evidence comparing the overall survival of patients treated with these 2 options. METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for rEC cases diagnosed from 2003 through 2011. Patients with previous cancers, cervical rEC, clinical stage T1N0 disease, or metastasis were excluded. cCR was defined as radiotherapy administered within 30 days of chemotherapy. CRSx was defined as cCR followed by esophagectomy within 90 days. Overall survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier methods, propensity score matching, and extended Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: Of the 11,122 eligible patients, 8091 (72.7%) received cCR and 3031 (27.3%) received CRSx. The odds of receiving CRSx were higher among patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage II disease (vs stage III), adenocarcinoma (vs squamous cell carcinoma), lesions of the lower one-third of the esophagus, private insurance, and those living >25 miles from the treating facility or in areas with a higher median income or a greater percentage of high school-educated residents. Patients aged >70 years, female patients, African-American patients, those with >/=2 comorbidities, or those treated at community programs were more likely to receive cCR. After propensity score matching, the median and 10-year survival rates were found to be significantly better with CRSx (32.5 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 29.6-34.8 months] and 23.8% months [95% CI, 20.0-27.9 months], respectively) compared with cCR (14.2 months [95% CI, 13.4-15.5 months] and 6.1% months [95% CI, 3.9-9.0 months], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Data from the National Cancer Data Base support the inclusion of surgery after concurrent chemoradiotherapy for patients with locally advanced rEC. Cancer 2017;123:3476-85.

BACKGROUND: This study seeks to examine the relation between sociodemographic characteristics and the utilization of fertility preservation services in reproductive age women diagnosed with cancer. METHODS: A total of 1041 women diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 18 and 40 years responded to a retrospective survey on demographic information and reproductive health history. Five cancer types were included: leukemia, Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and gastrointestinal cancer. Nine hundred eighteen women reported treatment with potential to affect fertility (chemotherapy, pelvic radiation, pelvic surgery, or bone marrow transplant). Student t test, linear regression, and multivariate logistic regression were used where appropriate to determine the relation between sociodemographic characteristics and the odds of using fertility preservation services. RESULTS: Sixty-one percent of women were counseled on the risk of cancer treatment to fertility by the oncology team. Overall, 4% of women pursued fertility preservation. In multivariate analysis, women who had not attained a bachelor's degree (odds ratio [OR], 0.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5-0.9) were less likely to be counseled. Trends also suggested possible disparities in access to fertility preservation with age older than 35 years (OR, 0.1; 95% CI, 0.0-1.4) or previous children (OR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.1-1.1) at diagnosis. Disparities in access to fertility preservation based on ethnicity and sexual orientation were also observed. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic health disparities likely affect access to fertility preservation services. Although awareness of fertility preservation has improved in the past decade, an unmet need remains for reproductive health counseling and fertility preservation in reproductive age women diagnosed with cancer.

This study presents a unique series of malignant supratentorial gliomas in children previously cured from non-CNS primary cancer. On neuroimaging these tumors were not specific, so the patients were suspected of cerebral recurrence of their primary neoplasm: leukemia in four children and sarcoma in one child. Histologically, the group contained four glioblastomas and one anaplastic astrocytoma. Three patients underwent neurosurgical resection, while the other two underwent stereotactic diagnostic biopsy only. Despite combined oncological treatment, four children died during 20 months, and only one glioblastoma patient continued to live for another twelve years. Microscopically, the neoplasms consisted of small cells with some morphologic features of astrocytic lineage, having scanty or prominent processes. Microvascular proliferation and focal or diffuse necrosis were encountered in four cases. The GFAP reactivity in neoplastic cells was low or nil, together with the expression of Olig2, vimentin, and nestin. In two cases a subpopulation of synaptophysin-positive cells was present. Molecular immunohistochemical profiling revealed the expression of phosphorylated forms of PI3Kp110 and AKT, in parallel to a strong PTEN and p53 positivity. The tumors were of IDH1R132H-wild type and immunoreactive for ATRX, HER3, and EGFR. Secondary malignant gliomas in pediatric cancer survivors pose a diagnostic challenge. The present study shows that these tumors are of IDH wild type, PI3K/AKT-activated, having no PTEN and EGFR mutations. Therefore, the biopsy of brain tumors in such patients is crucial both for accurate diagnosis and material preservation for molecular typing.

BACKGROUND: In the first CONCORD study (2008), 5-year survival for patients diagnosed with colon cancer between 1990 and 1994 in the United States was among the highest in the world (60%), but there were large racial disparities in most participating states. The CONCORD-2 study (2015) enabled the examination of survival trends between 1995 and 2009 for US states by race and stage. METHODS: The authors analyzed data from 37 state population-based cancer registries, covering approximately 80% of the US population, for patients who were diagnosed with colon cancer between 2001 and 2009 and were followed through 2009. Survival up to 5 years was corrected for background mortality (net survival) using state-specific and race-specific life tables and age-standardized using the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Survival is presented by race (all, black, white), stage, state, and calendar period (2001-2003 and 2004-2009) to account for changes in methods used to collect stage. RESULTS: Five-year net survival increased by 0.9%, from 63.7% between 2001 and 2003 to 64.6% between 2004 and 2009. More black than white patients were diagnosed with distant-stage disease between 2001 and 2003 (21.5% vs 17.2%) and between 2004 and 2009 (23.3% vs 18.8%). Survival improved for both blacks and whites, but 5-year net survival was 9-10% lower for blacks than for whites both between 2001 and 2003 (54.7% vs 64.5%) and between 2004 and 2009 (56.6% vs 65.4%). The absolute difference between blacks and whites decreased by only 1% during the decade. CONCLUSIONS: Five-year net survival from colon cancer increased slightly over time. Survival among blacks diagnosed between 2004 and 2009 had still not reached the level of that among whites diagnosed between 1990 and 1994, some 15 to 20 years earlier. These findings suggest a need for more targeted efforts to improve screening and to ensure timely, appropriate treatment, especially for blacks, to reduce this large and persistent disparity in survival.

BACKGROUND: Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms are secondary malignancies that are often fatal, but their risk factors are not well understood. Evidence suggests that individuals with clonal haemopoiesis have increased risk of developing haematological malignancies. We aimed to identify whether patients with cancer who have clonal haemopoiesis are at an increased risk of developing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. METHODS: We did this retrospective case-control study to compare the prevalence of clonal haemopoiesis between patients treated for cancer who later developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (cases) and patients who did not develop these neoplasms (controls). All patients in both case and control groups were treated at MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX, USA) from 1997 to 2015. We used the institutional medical database to locate these patients. Patients were included as cases if they were treated for a primary cancer, subsequently developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, and had available paired samples of bone marrow from the time of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm diagnosis and peripheral blood from the time of primary cancer diagnosis. Patients were eligible for inclusion as age-matched controls if they were treated for lymphoma, received combination chemotherapy, and did not develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasms after at least 5 years of follow-up. We used molecular barcode sequencing of 32 genes on the pretreatment peripheral blood samples to detect clonal haemopoiesis. For cases, we also used targeted gene sequencing on bone marrow samples and investigated clonal evolution from clonal haemopoiesis to the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. To further clarify the association between clonal haemopoiesis and therapy-related myeloid neoplasm development, we also analysed the prevalence of clonal haemopoiesis in an external cohort of patients with lymphoma who were treated in a randomised trial of front-line chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, with or without melatonin. This trial was done at MD Anderson Cancer Center between 1999 and 2001 (protocol number 98-009). FINDINGS: We identified 14 cases and 54 controls. Of the 14 cases, we detected clonal haemopoiesis in the peripheral blood samples of ten (71%) patients. We detected clonal haemopoiesis in 17 (31%) of the 54 controls. The cumulative incidence of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms in both cases and controls at 5 years was significantly higher in patients with clonal haemopoiesis (30%, 95% CI 16-51) than in those without (7%, 2-21; p=0.016). In the external cohort, five (7%) of 74 patients developed therapy-related myeloid neoplasms, of whom four (80%) had clonal haemopoiesis; 11 (16%) of 69 patients who did not develop therapy-related myeloid neoplasms had clonal haemopoiesis. In the external cohort, the cumulative incidence of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms at 10 years was significantly higher in patients with clonal haemopoiesis (29%, 95% CI 8-53) than in those without (0%, 0-0; p=0.0009). In a multivariate Fine and Gray model based on the external cohort, the presence of clonal haemopoiesis significantly increased the risk of therapy-related myeloid neoplasm development (hazard ratio 13.7, 95% CI 1.7-108.7; p=0.013). INTERPRETATION: Preleukaemic clonal haemopoiesis is common in patients with therapy-related myeloid neoplasms at the time of their primary cancer diagnosis and before they have been exposed to treatment. Our results suggest that clonal haemopoiesis could be used as a predictive marker to identify patients with cancer who are at risk of developing therapy-related myeloid neoplasms. A prospective trial to validate this concept is warranted.

PURPOSE: Patients diagnosed with a specific neoplasm tend to have a subsequent excess risk of the same neoplasm. The age incidence of a second neoplasm at the same site is approximately constant with age, and consequently the relative risk is greater at younger age. It is unclear whether such a line of reasoning can be extended from a specific neoplasm to the incidence of all neoplasms in subjects diagnosed with a defined neoplasm. METHODS: We considered the age-specific incidence of all non-hormone-related epithelial neoplasms after a first primary colorectal cancer (n = 9542) in the Vaud Cancer Registry data set. RESULTS: In subjects with a previous colorectal cancer, the incidence rate of all other epithelial non-hormone-related cancers was stable around 800 per 100,000 between age 30 and 60 years, and rose only about twofold to reach 1685 at age 70 to 79 years and 1826 per 100,000 at age 80 years or older. After excluding synchronous cancers, the rise was only about 1.5-fold, that is, from about 700 to 1000. In the general population, the incidence rate of all epithelial non-hormone-related cancers was 29 per 100,000 at age 30 to 39 years, and rose 30-fold to 883 per 100,000 at age 70 to 79 years. Excluding colorectal cancers, the rise of all non-hormone-related cancers was from 360 per 100,000 at age 40 to 49 years to 940 at age 70 to 79 years after colorectal cancer, and from 90 to 636 per 100,000 in the general population (i.e., 2.6- vs. 7.1-fold). CONCLUSIONS: The rise of incidence with age of all epithelial non-hormone-related second cancers after colorectal cancer is much smaller than in the general population. This can possibly be related to the occurrence of a single mutational event in a population of susceptible individuals, although alternative models are plausible within the complexity of the process of carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND: Adiposity traits have been associated with risk of many cancers in observational studies, but whether these associations are causal is unclear. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic predictors of risk factors as instrumental variables to eliminate reverse causation and reduce confounding bias. We performed MR analyses to assess the possible causal relationship of birthweight, childhood and adult body mass index (BMI), and waist-hip ratio (WHR) on the risks of breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers. METHODS: We tested the association between genetic risk scores and each trait using summary statistics from published genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and from 51 537 cancer cases and 61 600 controls in the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON) Consortium. RESULTS: We found an inverse association between the genetic score for childhood BMI and risk of breast cancer [odds ratio (OR) = 0.71 per standard deviation (s.d.) increase in childhood BMI; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.60, 0.80; P = 6.5 x 10(-5)). We also found the genetic score for adult BMI to be inversely associated with breast cancer risk (OR = 0.66 per s.d. increase in BMI; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.77; P = 2.5 x 10(-7)), and positively associated with ovarian cancer (OR = 1.35; 95% CI: 1.05, 1.72; P = 0.017), lung cancer (OR = 1.27; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.49; P = 2.9 x 10(-3)) and colorectal cancer (OR = 1.39; 95% CI: 1.06, 1.82, P = 0.016). The inverse association between genetically predicted adult BMI and breast cancer risk remained even after adjusting for directional pleiotropy via MR-Egger regression. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study provide additional understandings of the complex relationship between adiposity and cancer risks. Our results for breast and lung cancer are particularly interesting, given previous reports of effect heterogeneity by menopausal status and smoking status.

Constitutional MisMatch Repair Deficiency (CMMRD) is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous germline variants in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes (MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, MLH1). This syndrome results in early onset colorectal cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, brain tumors and other malignancies. Children with CMMRD are at high risk of developing multiple cancers and cancer surveillance does not guarantee detection of cancer at a curable stage. The development of a preventive treatment strategy would be a major step forward. Long-term daily use of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has been shown to reduce cancer risk in individuals with Lynch syndrome (LS). LS is caused by heterozygous germline variants of MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and MLH1 and characterized by an increased risk of developing colorectal and endometrial cancer at adult age. Here we discuss the potential use of ASA for cancer prevention in patients with CMMRD.

BACKGROUND: Increased cancer risk has been reported among workers in the rubber manufacturing industry employed before the 1960s. It is unclear whether risk remains increased among workers hired subsequently. The present study focused on risk of cancer mortality for rubber workers first employed since 1975 in 64 factories. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Anonymized data from cohorts of rubber workers employed for at least 1 year from Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, and the UK were pooled. Standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), based on country-specific death rates, were reported for bladder and lung cancer (primary outcomes of interest), for other selected cancer sites, and for cancer sites with a minimum of 10 deaths in men or women. Analyses stratified by type of industry, period, and duration of employment were carried out. RESULTS: A total of 38 457 individuals (29 768 men; 8689 women) contributed to 949 370 person-years. No increased risk of bladder cancer was observed [SMR = 0.80, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.46; 1.38]. The risk of lung cancer death was reduced (SMR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.70; 0.94). No statistically significant increased risk was observed for any other cause of death. A reduced risk was evident for total cancer mortality (SMR = 0.81, 95% CI 0.76; 0.87). Risks were lower for workers in the tyre industry compared with workers in the general rubber goods sector. Analysis by employment duration showed a negative trend with SMRs decreasing with increasing duration of employment. In an analysis of secondary end points, when stratified by type of industry and period of first employment, excess risks of myeloma and gastric cancer were observed each due, essentially, to results from one centre. CONCLUSION: No consistent increased risk of cancer death was observed among rubber workers first employed since 1975, no overall analysis of the pooled cohort produced significantly increased risk. Continued surveillance of the present cohorts is required to confirm the absence of long-term risk.

BACKGROUND: The number of older cancer survivors is increasing as more adults survive to older ages. The objectives of this study were to examine trajectories of physical activity (PA) and physical function (PF) over a 2-year lifestyle counseling study and to identify characteristics of the trajectory groups. METHODS: This was a secondary analysis of Reach Out to Enhance Wellness, a randomized controlled trial of home-based lifestyle counseling. The 641 participants were older (>/=65 years), overweight (body mass index [BMI], 25 to <40 kg/m(2)), long-term community-dwelling survivors (>5 years) of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer from Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States (21 states) who had been randomly assigned to an immediate intervention or a 12-month-wait-listed control arm. The main outcome measures were PA and PF trajectory group membership. RESULTS: Three PA groups and 5 PF trajectory groups were observed. The baseline BMI (P < .001) and self-efficacy for performing strength (P < .0001) and endurance exercises (P < .0002) were the strongest predictors of achieving the highest amount of PA and the most favorable functional trajectory over 2 years. Individuals with low baseline self-efficacy, no PA, and a Short Form 36 PF subscale score < 65 did not benefit from the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified characteristics of survivors who benefited from home-based interventions and suggested alternative approaches for survivors requiring more structured and intensive interventions to promote behavioral changes.

BACKGROUND: Recent changes in head and neck cancer epidemiology have created a need for improved lymph node prognostics. This article compares the prognostic value of the number of positive nodes (pN) with the value of the lymph node ratio (LNR) and American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) N staging in surgical patients. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database was used to identify cases of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas from 2004 to 2012. The sample was grouped by the AJCC N stage, LNR, and pN and was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. The sample was also analyzed by the site of the primary tumor. RESULTS: This study identified 12,437 patients. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed superior prognostic ability for LNR and pN staging in comparison with AJCC staging. Patients with a pN value > 5 had the worst overall survival (5-year survival rate, 16%). Patients with oropharyngeal tumors had better outcomes for all groupings, and a pN value > 5 for oropharyngeal cancers was associated with decreased survival. Multivariate regressions demonstrated larger hazard ratios (HRs) and a lower Akaike information criterion for the pN model versus the AJCC stage and LNR models. The HRs were 1.78 (95% confidence interval, 1.62-1.95) for a pN value of 1, 2.53 (95% confidence interval, 2.32-2.75) for a pN value of 2 to 5, and 4.64 (95% confidence interval, 4.18-5.14) for a pN value > 5. CONCLUSIONS: The pN models demonstrated superior prognostic value in comparison with the LNR and AJCC N staging. Future modifications of the nodal staging system should be based on the pN with a separate system for oropharyngeal cancers. Future trials should consider examining adjuvant treatment escalation in patients with >5 lymph nodes. Cancer 2016;122:1388-1397. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Mesothelium vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression in the metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) microenvironment is induced by tumor and mediates tumor cell invasion. VCAM-1 imaging suggests expression during treatment is an indicator of platinum resistance. Here, we assess the potential prognostic significance of mesothelium VCAM-1 expression and prospectively evaluate whether soluble VCAM-1 (sVCAM-1) is a surrogate for mesothelium expression. METHODS: A retrospective review of EOC patients was performed to evaluate outcomes with mesothelium VCAM-1 expression determined by immunohistochemistry of peritoneum or omentum specimens. A prospective cohort of EOC patients was identified and followed through primary treatment. Serum for sVCAM-1 evaluation, which was performed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was collected before surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy and at each treatment cycle. Peritoneal specimens were obtained during debulking to assess mesothelial VCAM-1 expression. RESULTS: A retrospective review identified 54 advanced-stage EOC patients. Patients expressing mesothelium VCAM-1 had shortened overall survival (44 vs 79 months, P = 0.035) and progression-free survival (18 vs 67 months, P = 0.010); the median time to platinum resistance was 36 months for VCAM-1-expressing patients and not yet determined for the VCAM-1-negative group. In our prospective observational cohort, 18 EOC patients completed primary treatment; 3 were negative for mesothelium VCAM-1 expression, and sVCAM-1 did not vary between groups. CONCLUSIONS: Mesothelium VCAM-1 expression is negatively associated with progression-free and overall survival in EOC. This is especially compelling in light of previous data suggesting that persistent VCAM-1 expression during treatment is an indicator of platinum resistance. Our pilot study had insufficient cases to determine whether sVCAM-1 would substitute for mesothelium expression. Cancer 2017;123:977-84. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: During the Vietnam War, US and allied military sprayed approximately 77 million liters of tactical herbicides including Agent Orange, contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. To the authors' knowledge, few studies to date have examined the association between Agent Orange exposure and cancer incidence among Korean veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War. METHODS: An Agent Orange exposure index, based on the proximity of the veteran's military unit to the area that was sprayed with Agent Orange, was developed using a geographic information system-based model. Cancer incidence was followed for 180,251 Vietnam veterans from 1992 through 2003. RESULTS: After adjustment for age and military rank, high exposure to Agent Orange was found to significantly increase the risk of all cancers combined (adjusted hazards ratio [aHR], 1.08). Risks for cancers of the mouth (aHR, 2.54), salivary glands (aHR, 6.96), stomach (aHR, 1.14), and small intestine (aHR, 2.30) were found to be significantly higher in the high-exposure group compared with the low-exposure group. Risks for cancers of all sites combined (aHR, 1.02) and for cancers of the salivary glands (aHR, 1.47), stomach (aHR, 1.03), small intestine (aHR, 1.24), and liver (aHR, 1.02) were elevated with a 1-unit increase in the exposure index. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to Agent Orange several decades earlier may increase the risk of cancers in all sites combined, as well as several specific cancers, among Korean veterans of the Vietnam War, including some cancers that were not found to be clearly associated with exposure to Agent Orange in previous cohort studies primarily based on Western populations.

BACKGROUND: Studies of obesity and survival among patients with breast cancer produce conflicting results, possibly because of heterogeneity by molecular subtype. METHODS: This study examined whether the association of body mass index (BMI) at diagnosis with breast cancer recurrence and survival varied across subtypes defined by PAM50 (Prediction Analysis of Microarray 50) gene expression. Included were 1559 Kaiser Permanente Northern California members ages 18 to 79 years who had PAM50 assays and were diagnosed with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I through III breast cancer from 1996 to 2013. Patients reported weight and height. Cox regression models were adjusted for age, menopause, race/ethnicity, stage, and chemotherapy. RESULTS: Over a median of 9 years (maximum, 19 years), 378 women developed recurrent disease, and 312 died from breast cancer. Overall, BMI was not associated with breast cancer recurrence or survival when controlling for subtype (eg, the hazard ratio per 5 kg/m(2) of BMI was 1.05 [95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.15] for breast cancer-specific death). However, associations varied by subtype. Among women with luminal A cancers, those who had class II/III obesity, but not class I obesity or overweight, had worse outcomes. When women who had a BMI >/=35 kg/m(2) were compared with those who had a BMI from 18.5 to <25 kg/m(2) , the hazard ratio was 2.24 (95% confidence interval,1.22-4.11) for breast cancer-specific death and 1.24 (95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.54) for recurrence. There was no association within luminal B, basal-like or human epidermal growth factor over-expressing subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients who had accurately classified breast cancer subtypes based on gene expression, a BMI >/=35 kg/m(2) was adversely associated with outcomes only among those who had luminal A cancers. Research is needed into whether tailoring recommendations for weight management to tumor characteristics will improve outcomes. Cancer 2017;123:2535-42. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The real-world occurrence rate of non-breast cancer-specific death (non-BCSD) and its impact on patients with breast cancer are poorly recognized. METHODS: Women with resectable breast cancer from 1990 to 2007 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (n = 199,963) were analyzed. The outcome events of breast cancer were classified as breast cancer-specific death (BCSD), non-BCSD, or survival. Binary logistics was used to estimate the occurrence rates of non-BCSD and BCSD with different clinicopathological factors. The Gray method was used to measure the cumulative incidence of non-BCSD and BCSD. The ratio of non-BCSDs to all causes of death and stacked cumulative incidence function plots were used to present the impact of non-BCSD on overall survival (OS). Models of Cox proportional hazards regression and competing risk regression were compared to highlight the suitable model. RESULTS: There were 12,879 non-BCSDs (6.44%) and 28,784 BCSDs (14.39%). The oldest age group (>62 years), black race, and a single or divorced marital status were associated with more non-BCSDs. With adjustments for age, a hormone receptor-positive (HoR+) status was no longer related to increased non-BCSDs. In patients with grade 1, stage I disease and an HoR+ status as well as the oldest subgroup, a great dilution of non-BCSD on all causes of death could be observed, and this led to incorrect interpretations. The inaccuracy, caused by the commonly used Cox proportional hazards model, could be corrected by a competing risk model. CONCLUSIONS: OS was largely impaired by non-BCSD during early breast cancer. For some future clinical trial planning, especially for the oldest patients and those with HoR+ breast cancer, non-BCSD should be considered a competing risk event. Cancer 2017;123:2432-43.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer (BC) disparities may widen with genomic advances. The authors compared non-Hispanic white (NHW), black, and Hispanic BC survivors for 1) cancer risk-management practices among BRCA carriers and 2) provider discussion and receipt of genetic testing. METHODS: A population-based sample of NHW, black, and Hispanic women who had been diagnosed with invasive BC at age 50 years or younger from 2009 to 2012 were recruited through the state cancer registry. Multiple logistic regression was used to compare cancer risk-management practices in BRCA carriers and associations of demographic and clinical variables with provider discussion and receipt of testing. RESULTS: Of 1622 participants, 159 of 440 (36.1%) black women, 579 of 897 (64.5%) NHW women, 58 of 117 (49.6%) Spanish-speaking Hispanic women, and 116 of 168 (69%) English-speaking Hispanic women underwent BRCA testing, of whom 90 had a pathogenic BRCA mutation identified. Among BRCA carriers, the rates of risk-reducing mastectomy and risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy were significantly lower among black women compared with Hispanic and NHW women after controlling for clinical and demographic variables (P = .025 and P = .008, respectively). Compared with NHW women, discussion of genetic testing with a provider was 16 times less likely among black women (P < .0001) and nearly 2 times less likely among Spanish-speaking Hispanic women (P = .04) after controlling for clinical and sociodemographic factors. CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggest that the rates of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy are lower among black BRCA carriers compared with their Hispanic and NHW counterparts, which is concerning because benefits from genetic testing arise from cancer risk-management practice options. Furthermore, lower BRCA testing rates among blacks may partially be because of a lower likelihood of provider discussion. Future studies are needed to improve cancer risk identification and management practices across all populations to prevent the widening of disparities. Cancer 2017;123:2497-05.

BACKGROUND: The extent to which cancer exacerbates or creates new health conditions is a long-standing, unanswered question. The current prospective study examined the short-term impact of cancer on the functioning, development of, and worsening of age-related health conditions among older adults who develop cancer compared with age-matched controls. METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry data were linked with Medicare Health Outcomes Survey (MHOS) data. A total of 921 eligible cases were Medicare beneficiaries with diagnosis of breast, colorectal, lung, or prostate cancer made between their baseline and follow-up MHOS. Using propensity score matching, 4605 controls without cancer were matched from the MHOS. Analysis of covariance and logistic regression were used to examine changes in physical functioning, activities of daily living, age-related conditions, and exacerbation of preexisting conditions for cases compared with controls. RESULTS: Cancer groups demonstrated greater declines in activities of daily living and physical function compared with controls (mean, -1.53 [standard error, 0.14]), with the greatest change noted for patients with lung cancer (mean, -6.72 [standard error, 0.94]). Having a cancer diagnosis increased the risk of depression but did not increase the odds of developing arthritis in the hand and/or hip, urinary incontinence (except for prostate cancer), or vision and/or hearing problems. Having a cancer diagnosis also did not exacerbate the severity of arthritis or foot neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study suggest that cancer is a stronger driver for declines in physical functioning and an increased risk of depression in older adults. Interventions are needed to decrease these risks. Clinicians need to prepare patients and families for changes in functioning levels and interventions that limit the declines for older patients with cancer are needed. Cancer 2016;122:1946-53.

BACKGROUND: Medicare Part D was designed to reduce out-of-pocket (OOP) costs for Medicare beneficiaries, but to the authors' knowledge the extent to which this occurred for patients with cancer has not been measured to date. The objective of the current study was to examine the impact of Medicare Part D eligibility on OOP cost for prescription drugs and use of medical services among patients with cancer. METHODS: Using the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for the years 2002 through 2010, a differences-in-differences analysis estimated the effects of Medicare Part D eligibility on OOP pharmaceutical costs and medical use. The authors compared per capita OOP cost and use between Medicare beneficiaries (aged >/=65 years) with cancer to near-elderly patients aged 55 years to 64 years with cancer. Statistical weights were used to generate nationally representative estimates. RESULTS: A total of 1878 near-elderly and 4729 individuals with Medicare were included (total of 6607 individuals). The mean OOP pharmaceutical cost for Medicare beneficiaries before the enactment of Part D was $1158 (standard error, +/-$52) and decreased to $501 (standard error, +/-$30), a decline of 43%. Compared with changes in OOP pharmaceutical costs for nonelderly patients with cancer over the same period, the implementation of Medicare Part D was associated with a further reduction of $356 per person. Medicare Part D appeared to have no significant impact on the use of medications, hospitalizations, or emergency department visits, but was associated with a reduction of 1.55 in outpatient visits. CONCLUSIONS: Medicare D has reduced OOP prescription drug costs and outpatient visits for seniors with cancer beyond trends observed for younger patients, with no major impact on the use of other medical services noted.

BACKGROUND: Improving symptoms is a major goal of cancer medicine; however, symptom response is often based on group differences and not individualized. In the current study, the authors examined the personalized symptom goal (PSG) for 10 common symptoms in patients with advanced cancer, and identified the factors associated with PSG response. METHODS: In this prospective, longitudinal, multicenter study, patients from 5 tertiary care hospitals rated the intensity of 10 symptoms using a numeric rating scale of 0 to 10 at the time of their first clinic visit and then at a second visit 14 to 34 days later. The PSG was determined for each symptom by asking patients: "At what level would you feel comfortable with this symptom?" using the same scale of 0 to 10 for symptom intensity. PSG response was defined as symptom intensity at the time of the second visit that was less than or equal to the PSG. RESULTS: Among 728 patients, the median PSG was 1 for nausea; 2 for depression, anxiety, drowsiness, well-being, dyspnea, and sleep; and 3 for pain, fatigue, and appetite. A greater percentage of patients achieved a PSG response at their second visit compared with their first visit (P<.05 except for drowsiness). Symptom response was associated with lower baseline symptom intensity based on PSG criterion but higher baseline symptom intensity based on the traditional minimal clinically important difference definition (P<.001 for all symptoms). In multivariable analysis, higher PSG and nationality were associated with greater PSG response. CONCLUSIONS: The PSG was </=3 for a majority of patients. PSG response allows clinicians to tailor treatment goals while adjusting for individual differences in scale interpretation and factors associated with symptom response. Cancer 2016;122:1774-81.

Improved molecular understanding of tumor microenvironment has resulted in the identification of various cancer cell targets for diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, including the receptor for the FSH, a glycoprotein hormone responsible for growth, maturation, and function of human reproductive system. The expression and localization of the FSH receptor (FSHR)-protein were associated with the tumor epithelial cells and/or with the peripheral tumor blood vessels. The available evidence indicates that in ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer, the tumor epithelial FSHR promotes proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. The vascular endothelial FSHR, detected in 11 types of solid tumors and 11 types of sarcomas, is involved in receptor-mediated transendothelial transport of FSH, tumor angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling. In contrast to intratumor vessels, which are abnormal and disorganized, the FSHR-positive blood microvessels are arranged in a hierarchical pattern: arterioles-capillaries-venules. The FSHR-positive blood vessels make connections between the intratumor vessels and the general blood circulation of patients. In this mini-review, I summarize these studies and discuss the rationale for developing a strategy for cancer therapy based on FSHR expressed on the luminal endothelial cell surface of blood vessels located in the peritumoral area rather than endothelial markers expressed in the core of tumors. Because FSHR is a common marker of peritumoral vessels, therapeutic agents coupled to anti-FSHR humanized antibodies should in principle be applicable to a wide range of tumor types.

BACKGROUND: Indications for postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) in patients with T1 to T2, lymph node-negative (N0) breast cancer with "high-risk" features are controversial. The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 22922 and National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group MA20 trials reporting improved 10-year disease-free survival with lymph node irradiation included patients with high-risk N0 disease, but, to the authors' knowledge, benefits in patients receiving modern systemic therapy are uncertain. METHODS: The authors retrospectively identified patients with T1 to T2N0 disease who were treated with mastectomy from January 2006 through December 2011. High-risk features included age <40 years, multifocality/multicentricity, lymphovascular invasion, medial/central tumor location, and high nuclear grade. RESULTS: Among 672 eligible patients, only 15 received PMRT and were excluded. Of the remaining 657 patients, 187 (28%) had 1 high-risk feature and 449 patients (68%) had >/= 2 high-risk features. A total of 36 patients with unknown tumor grade were excluded from risk analysis. Approximately 98% of patients underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy alone and 86% received adjuvant systemic therapy. At a median of 5.6 years of follow-up, the locoregional disease recurrence (LRR) rate was 4.7% (31 patients). Increasing tumor size was found to be associated with LRR (hazard ratio, 1.70; P = .006), whereas other high-risk features were not (all P > .05). Receipt of systemic therapy decreased the LRR rate (hazard ratio, 0.40; P = .03). Although crude LRR rates increased from 3.8% to 9.4% with 1 versus >/= 4 high-risk features, the number of risk factors was not found to be significantly associated with LRR (P = .54). CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, a low crude LRR rate (4.7%) was observed in a large unselected cohort of patients with T1 to T2N0 breast cancer with high-risk features who were treated with mastectomy and systemic therapy without PMRT. Although increasing tumor size and the omission of systemic therapy were found to be predictive, other features did not confer a higher LRR risk either independently or together, and do not by themselves mandate the use of PMRT in this patient population.

We translated two cancer vaccine strategies from mice into human clinical trials. (1) In preclinical studies on TARP, an antigen expressed in most prostate cancers, we mapped epitopes presented by HLA-A*0201, modified them to increase affinity and immunogenicity in HLA transgenic mice, and induced human T cells that killed human cancer cells ("epitope enhancement"). In a clinical trial, HLA-A2(+) prostate cancer patients with PSA biochemical recurrence (Stage D0) were vaccinated with two peptides either in Montanide-ISA51 or on autologous dendritic cells (DCs). In stage D0, the Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) slope is prognostic of time to radiographic evidence of metastases and death. With no difference between arms, 74% of combined subjects had a decreased PSA slope at 1 year compared to their own baseline slopes (p = 0.0004). For patients vaccinated with DCs, response inversely correlated with a tolerogenic DC signature. A randomized placebo-controlled phase II trial is underway. (2) HER2 is a driver surface oncogene product expressed in multiple tumors. We made an adenoviral vector vaccine expressing the extracellular and transmembrane domains of HER2 and cured mice with large established HER2(+) tumors, dependent on antibodies to HER2, not T cells. The mechanism differed from that of trastuzumab. We tested a human version in advanced metastatic cancer patients naive to HER2-directed therapies. At the second and third dose levels, 45% of evaluable patients showed clinical benefit. Circulating tumor cells also declined in some vaccinated patients. Thus, cancer vaccines developed in mice were successfully translated to humans with promising early results.

INTRODUCTION: Lack of health insurance limits access to preventive services, including cancer screening. We examined the effects of Medicare eligibility on the appropriate use of cancer screening services in the United States. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional analysis of the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor and Surveillance System (analyzed in 2014). Univariable and logistic regression analyses were performed for participants aged 60-64 and 66-70 to examine the effects of Medicare eligibility on prevalence of self-reported screening for colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers. Sub-analyses were performed among low-income (<$25,000 annual/household) individuals. RESULTS: Medicare-eligible individuals were significantly more likely to undergo all examined preventive services (colorectal cancer OR: 1.90; 95% CI 1.79-2.04; prostate cancer OR: 1.29; 95% CI 1.17-1.43; breast cancer OR: 1.23; 95% CI 1.10-1.37) and the effect was most pronounced among low-income individuals (colorectal cancer OR: 2.04; 95% CI 1.8-2.32; prostate cancer OR: 1.39; 95% CI 1.12-1.72; breast cancer OR: 1.42, 95% CI 1.20-1.67). Access to a healthcare provider was the strongest independent predictor of undergoing appropriate screening, ranging from OR 2.73 (95% CI 2.20-3.39) for colorectal cancer screening in the low-income population to OR 4.79 (95% CI 3.95-5.81) for breast cancer screening in the overall cohort. The difference in screening prevalence was most pronounced when comparing Medicare-eligible participants to uninsured Medicare-ineligible participants (+33.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Medicare eligibility impacts the prevalence of cancer screening, likely as a result of increased access to primary care. Low-income individuals benefit most from Medicare eligibility. Expanded public insurance coverage to these individuals may improve access to preventive services.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the impact of modeling cancer drug wastage in economic evaluations because wastage can result from single-dose vials on account of body surface area- or weight-based dosing. METHODS: Intravenous chemotherapy drugs were identified from the pan-Canadian Oncology Drug Review (pCODR) program as of January 2015. Economic evaluations performed by drug manufacturers and pCODR were reviewed. Cost-effectiveness analyses and budget impact analyses were conducted for no-wastage and maximum-wastage scenarios (ie, the entire unused portion of the vial was discarded at each infusion). Sensitivity analyses were performed for a range of body surface areas and weights. RESULTS: Twelve drugs used for 17 indications were analyzed. Wastage was reported (ie, assumptions were explicit) in 71% of the models and was incorporated into 53% by manufacturers; this resulted in a mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increase of 6.1% (range, 1.3%-14.6%). pCODR reported and incorporated wastage for 59% of the models, and this resulted in a mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio increase of 15.0% (range, 2.6%-48.2%). In the maximum-wastage scenario, there was a mean increase in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 24.0% (range, 0.0%-97.2%), a mean increase in the 3-year total incremental budget costs of 26.0% (range, 0.0%-83.1%), and an increase in the 3-year total incremental drug budget cost of approximately CaD $102 million nationally. Changing the mean body surface area or body weight caused 45% of the drugs to have a change in the vial size and/or quantity, and this resulted in increased drug costs. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer drug wastage can increase drug costs but is not uniformly modeled in economic evaluations. Cancer 2017;123:3583-90. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Patient-reported quality of care, which is often measured by patients' overall rating of care, is gaining more attention within the field of oncology. The aim of this study was to examine factors that determine adult cancer patients' overall rating of prediagnosis care (PDC) and care provided during treatment (CDT). METHODS: Data were collected from 2 recurrent nationwide surveys among adult cancer patients in Denmark in 2010 and 2012. Analyses regarding PDC were based on the 2010 study population (n = 3681), and CDT analyses were based on the 2012 follow-up population (n = 2315). Multivariable logistic regression models were applied. RESULTS: Overall, 55.1% of patients reported excellent PDC and 61.9% reported excellent CDT. The odds of rating PDC and CDT as excellent differed significantly according to sex, age, and cancer diagnosis. Furthermore, the extent of supportive relatives, comorbidity, self-reported health, and region of treatment significantly determined ratings of CDT. Patients who reported negative experiences related to waiting time, information, coordination, and continuity of care during PDC and CDT, respectively, were significantly less likely overall to rate their care as excellent. The final regression models for PDC and CDT explained 38.2% and 30.6%, respectively, of the variance in the overall rating. CONCLUSION: Learning how patient characteristics influence the overall rating of care can enable health care providers to accommodate vulnerable patient groups. Identification of health care aspects that are independently associated with the overall rating of care may enable targeted efforts when planning and prioritizing initiatives aimed at improving the patient-experienced quality of care.

BACKGROUND: This article presents a first look at rates and trends for cases in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program diagnosed through 2013 using the February 2015 submission, and a validation of rates and trends from the February 2014 submission using the subsequent November 2014 submission. To the authors' knowledge, this is the second time SEER has published trends based on the early February submission. Three new cancer sites were added: cervix, thyroid, and liver/ intrahepatic bile duct. METHODS: A reporting delay model adjusted for the undercount of cases, which is substantially larger for the February than the subsequent November submission, was used. Joinpoint regression methodology was used to assess trends. Delay-adjusted rates and trends were checked to assess validity between the February and November 2014 submissions. RESULTS: The validation of rates and trends from the February and November 2014 submissions demonstrated even better agreement than the previously reported comparison between the February and November 2013 submissions, thereby affording additional confidence that the delay-adjusted February submission data can be used to produce valid estimates of incidence trends. Trends for cases diagnosed through 2013 revealed more rapid declines in female colon and rectal cancer and prostate cancer. A plateau in female melanoma trends and a slowing of the increases in thyroid cancer and male liver/intrahepatic bile duct cancer trends were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of early cancer data submissions can provide a preliminary indication of differences in incidence trends with an additional year of data. Although the delay adjustment correction adjusts for underreporting of cases, caution should be exercised when interpreting the results in this early submission. Cancer 2016;122:1579-87.

BACKGROUND: We conducted a randomized controlled trial of peer-counseling for newly diagnosed breast cancer (BC) patients as a community/research collaboration testing an intervention developed jointly by a community-based-organization serving women with cancer and university researchers. METHODS: We recruited 104 women newly diagnosed with BC at any disease stage. Prior to randomization, all received a one-time visit with an oncology nurse who offered information and resources. Afterwards, we randomized half to receive a match with a Navigator with whom they could have contact for up to 6 months. We recruited, trained, and supervised 30 peer counselors who became "Navigators." They were at least one-year post-diagnosis with BC. Controls received no further intervention. We tested the effect of intervention on breast-cancer-specific well-being and trauma symptoms as primary outcomes, and several secondary outcomes. In exploratory analyses, we tested whether responding to their diagnosis as a traumatic stressor moderated outcomes. RESULTS: We found that, compared with the control group, receiving a peer-counseling intervention significantly improved breast-cancer-specific well-being (p=0.01, Cohen's d=0.41) and maintained marital adjustment (p=0.01, Cohen's d=0.45) more effectively. Experiencing the diagnosis as a traumatic stressor moderated outcomes: those with a peer counselor in the traumatic stressor group improved significantly more than controls on well-being, trauma and depression symptoms, and cancer self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Having a peer counselor trained and supervised to recognize and work with trauma symptoms can improve well-being and psychosocial morbidity during the first year following diagnosis of BC.

BACKGROUND: Panel testing has been recently introduced to evaluate hereditary cancer; however, limited information is available regarding its use in kidney cancer. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed test results and clinical data from patients who underwent targeted multigene panel testing of up to 19 genes associated with hereditary kidney cancer from 2013 to 2016. The frequency of positive (mutation/variant likely pathogenic), inconclusive (variant of unknown significance), and negative results was evaluated. A logistic regression analysis evaluated predictive factors for a positive test. RESULTS: Patients (n = 1235) had a median age at diagnosis of 46 years, which was significantly younger than the US population of individuals with kidney cancer (P < .0001). Overall, 6.1%, 75.5%, and 18.4% of individuals had positive, negative, and inconclusive results, respectively. The most commonly altered genes included folliculin (FLCN) and fumarate hydratase (FH), which were altered in 1.8% and 1.3% of patients, respectively. Tuberous Sclerosis Complex 2 (TSC2), mesenchymal epithelial transition factor proto-oncogene (MET), and PMS1 homolog 2 (PMS2) had the highest rates of variants of unknown significance, which were identified in 2.7%, 2.2%, and 1.7% of patients, respectively. Early age of onset was the only factor that was identified as predictive of a positive test on multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 0.975; P = .0052) and may be the only identifying characteristic of low-penetrant syndromes, such as those associated with MITF (melanogenesis-associated transcription factor) mutations, which do not have singular histology or a family history of kidney cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Panel tests may be particularly useful for patients who lack distinguishing clinical characteristics of known hereditary kidney cancer syndromes. The current results support the use of early age of onset for genetic counseling and/or testing. Cancer 2017;123:4363-71. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The National Quality Forum has endorsed quality-improvement measures for multiple cancer types that are being developed into actionable tools to improve cancer care. No nationally endorsed quality metrics currently exist for head and neck cancer. METHODS: The authors identified patients with surgically treated, invasive, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma in the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 to 2014 and compared the rate of adherence to 5 different quality metrics and whether compliance with these quality metrics impacted overall survival. The metrics examined included negative surgical margins, neck dissection lymph node (LN) yield >/= 18, appropriate adjuvant radiation, appropriate adjuvant chemoradiation, adjuvant therapy within 6 weeks, as well as overall quality. RESULTS: In total, 76,853 eligible patients were identified. There was substantial variability in patient-level adherence, which was 80% for negative surgical margins, 73.1% for neck dissection LN yield, 69% for adjuvant radiation, 42.6% for adjuvant chemoradiation, and 44.5% for adjuvant therapy within 6 weeks. Risk-adjusted Cox proportional-hazard models indicated that all metrics were associated with a reduced risk of death: negative margins (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71-0.76), LN yield >/= 18 (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.89-0.96), adjuvant radiation (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.64-0.70), adjuvant chemoradiation (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.88), and adjuvant therapy </=6 weeks (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.89-0.96). Patients who received high-quality care had a 19% reduced adjusted hazard of mortality (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.79-0.83). CONCLUSIONS: Five head and neck cancer quality metrics were identified that have substantial variability in adherence and meaningfully impact overall survival. These metrics are appropriate candidates for national adoption. Cancer 2017;123:4372-81. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

The incidence of thyroid cancer has tripled over the past 3 decades, with the vast majority of the increase noted to be among small, indolent papillary thyroid carcinomas. Substantial overdiagnosis and potential overtreatment have led to a shift in clinical practice toward less aggressive approaches and a focus on improved risk stratification. This shift in practice may be associated with recent evidence suggesting that the increase in the incidence of thyroid cancer is slowing. Because patients are often young when they are diagnosed with thyroid cancer and because there is excellent long-term, disease-specific survival, there is an ever-growing population of survivors of thyroid cancer in the United States who accumulate substantial associated health care costs as they undergo surveillance and/or remedial treatment. Survivors of thyroid cancer can experience significant detriments to their quality of life and endure financial hardship. Future research should focus on the appropriateness of treatment as well as the financial and quality-of-life effects of thyroid cancer survivorship. Cancer 2016;122:3754-3759.

BACKGROUND: Navigators can facilitate timely access to cancer services, but to the authors' knowledge there are little data available regarding their economic impact. METHODS: The authors conducted a cost-consequence analysis of navigation versus usual care among 10,521 individuals with abnormal breast, cervical, colorectal, or prostate cancer screening results who enrolled in the Patient Navigation Research Program study from January 1, 2006 to March 31, 2010. Navigation costs included diagnostic evaluation, patient and staff time, materials, and overhead. Consequences or outcomes were time to diagnostic resolution and probability of resolution. Differences in costs and outcomes were evaluated using multilevel, mixed-effects regression modeling adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, language, marital status, insurance status, cancer, and site clustering. RESULTS: The majority of individuals were members of a minority (70.7%) and uninsured or publically insured (72.7%). Diagnostic resolution was higher for navigation versus usual care at 180 days (56.2% vs 53.8%; P = .008) and 270 days (70.0% vs 68.2%; P < .001). Although there were no differences in the average number of days to resolution between the 2 groups (110 days vs 109 days; P = .63), the probability of ever having diagnostic resolution was higher for the navigation group versus the usual-care group (84.5% vs 79.6%; P < .001). The added cost of navigation versus usual care was $275 per patient (95% confidence interval, $260-$290; P < .001). There was no significant difference in stage distribution among the 12.4% of patients in the navigation group vs 11% of the usual-care patients diagnosed with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Navigation adds costs and modestly increases the probability of diagnostic resolution among patients with abnormal screening test results. Navigation is only likely to be cost-effective if improved resolution translates into an earlier cancer stage at the time of diagnosis.

Since its registration in 1994 acetochlor has become a commonly used herbicide in the US, yet no epidemiologic study has evaluated its carcinogenicity in humans. We evaluated the use of acetochlor and cancer incidence among licensed pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study. In telephone interviews administered during 1999-2005, participants provided information on acetochlor use, use of other pesticides and additional potential confounders. We used Poisson regression to estimate relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for cancers that occurred from the time of interview through 2011 in Iowa and 2010 in North Carolina. Among 33,484 men, there were 4,026 applicators who used acetochlor and 3,234 incident cancers, with 304 acetochlor-exposed cases. Increased risk of lung cancer was observed among acetochlor users (RR = 1.74; 95% CI: 1.07-2.84) compared to nonusers, and among individuals who reported using acetochlor/atrazine product mixtures (RR = 2.33; 95% CI: 1.30-4.17), compared to nonusers of acetochlor. Colorectal cancer risk was significantly elevated among the highest category of acetochlor users (RR = 1.75; 95% CI: 1.08-2.83) compared to never users. Additionally, borderline significantly increased risk of melanoma (RR = 1.61; 95% CI: 0.98-2.66) and pancreatic cancer (RR = 2.36; 95% CI: 0.98-5.65) were observed among acetochlor users. The associations between acetochlor use and lung cancer, colorectal cancer, melanoma and pancreatic cancer are suggestive, however the lack of exposure-response trends, small number of exposed cases and relatively short time between acetochlor use and cancer development prohibit definitive conclusions.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the associations between angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and the risk of 10 major cancers by employing different pharmacoepidemiological assessments. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the first quarter of 2004 through 2012 were downloaded from the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were used to detect the signals. Furthermore, symmetry analysis was applied to the claims database to identify the risk of cancer after using ARBs from January 2005 to July 2013. RESULTS: Significant inverse associations were found for all cancer types assessed as a whole (ROR: 0.78, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.75 - 0.80; IC: -0.36, 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.31) in the analyses of FAERS database. Likewise, significant inverse association was found for all cancer types assessed as a whole (adjusted sequence ratio: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.82 - 0.96) in claims database. In addition, a significantly decreased risk for breast cancer and increased risks for pancreatic and prostate cancer were found in patients treated with ARBs in the analyses of individual cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Significant inverse association was found between ARB use and all cancer types assessed as a whole. However, in the analyses of individual cancers, the risks of ARB-induced cancer may differ according to cancer site. It may be reasonable to assume that the risks of ARB-induced cancer may differ according to cancer site..

Personalized cancer therapy is based on a patient's tumor lineage, histopathology, expression analyses, and/or tumor DNA or RNA analysis. Here, we aim to develop an in vitro functional assay of a patient's living cancer cells that could complement these approaches. We present methods for developing cell cultures from tumor biopsies and identify the types of samples and culture conditions associated with higher efficiency of model establishment. Toward the application of patient-derived cell cultures for personalized care, we established an immunofluorescence-based functional assay that quantifies cancer cell responses to targeted therapy in mixed cell cultures. Assaying patient-derived lung cancer cultures with this method showed promise in modeling patient response for diagnostic use. This platform should allow for the development of co-clinical trial studies to prospectively test the value of drug profiling on tumor-biopsy-derived cultures to direct patient care.

BACKGROUND: To reduce oral cancer mortality, an organized, population-based screening program for the early detection of oral premalignancy and oral cancer was designed for high-risk individuals with habits of betel quid chewing, cigarette smoking, or both. The objective of this report was to evaluate the long-term effectiveness of this program in reducing the incidence of advanced disease and deaths from oral cancer. METHODS: A nationwide, population-based screening program for oral cancer has been conducted in Taiwan since 2004. Residents aged >/= 18 years with oral habits of cigarette smoking and/or betel quid chewing were invited. The standardized mortality ratio method was used to compare the observed numbers of advanced oral cancers and deaths from oral cancer among screening attendees with the expected numbers derived from mortality among nonattendees. An intention-to-treat analysis of the relative rate of reductions in advanced-stage oral cancers and oral cancer mortality also was conducted. RESULTS: The overall screening rate was 55.1%. The relative risk of death from oral cancer was 0.53 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.56) as a result of screening compared with the expected risk of oral cancer deaths in the absence of screening. The corresponding relative risk was 0.74 (95% CI, 0.72-0.77) after adjusting for self-selection bias. The relative risk of advanced oral cancer for the screened group versus the nonscreened group was 0.62 (95% CI, 0.59-0.64), which increased to 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.82) after adjustment for self-selection bias. CONCLUSIONS: An organized, population-based oral cancer screening program targeting more than 2 million Taiwanese cigarette smokers and/or betel quid chewers demonstrated the effectiveness of reducing stage III or IV oral cancers and oral cancer mortality. These evidence-based findings corroborate and support the screening strategy of oral visual inspection for the prevention of oral cancer among high-risk individuals in areas with a high incidence of oral cancer.

BACKGROUND: A cancer diagnosis during adolescence or young adulthood may negatively influence social well-being. The existing literature concerning the social well-being of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer was reviewed to identify gaps in current research and highlight priority areas for future research. METHODS: A systematic review of the scientific literature published in English from 2000 through 2014 was performed. Eligible studies included patients and survivors diagnosed between the ages of 15 to 39 years that reported on social well-being domains in the City of Hope Cancer Survivor Quality of Life Model. Each article was reviewed for relevance using a standardized template. A total of 253 potential articles were identified. After exclusions, a final sample of 26 articles identified domains of social well-being that are believed to be understudied among AYAs with cancer: 1) educational attainment, employment, and financial burden; 2) social relationships; and 3) supportive care. Articles were read in their entirety, single coded, and summarized according to domain. RESULTS: AYAs with cancer report difficulties related to employment, educational attainment, and financial stability. They also report problems with the maintenance and development of peer and family relationships, intimate and marital relationships, and peer support. Supportive services are desired among AYAs. Few studies have reported results in reference to comparison samples or by cancer subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: Future research studies on AYAs with cancer should prioritize the inclusion of underserved AYA populations, more heterogeneous cancer samples, and comparison groups to inform the development of supportive services. Priority areas for potential intervention include education and employment reintegration, and social support networks.

Germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene, BRCA-1 associated protein (BAP1), underlie a tumor predisposition syndrome characterized by increased risk for numerous cancers including uveal melanoma, melanocytic tumors and mesothelioma, among others. In the present study we report the identification of a novel germline BAP1 mutation, c.1777C>T, which produces a truncated BAP1 protein product and segregates with cancer. Family members with this mutation demonstrated a primary clinical phenotype of autosomal dominant, early-onset melanocytic neoplasms with immunohistochemistry (IHC) of these tumors demonstrating lack of BAP1 protein expression. In addition, family members harboring the BAP1 c.1777C>T germline mutation developed other neoplastic disease including thyroid cancer. IHC analysis of the thyroid cancer, as well, demonstrated loss of BAP1 protein expression. Our investigation identifies a new BAP1 mutation, further highlights the relevance of BAP1 as a clinically important tumor suppressor gene, and broadens the range of cancers associated with BAP1 inactivation. Further study will be required to understand the full scope of BAP1-associated neoplastic disease.

In 1996, the Board of Directors of the American Cancer Society (ACS) challenged the United States to reduce what looked to be possible peak cancer mortality in 1990 by 50% by the year 2015. This analysis examines the trends in cancer mortality across this 25-year challenge period from 1990 to 2015. In 2015, cancer death rates were 26% lower than in 1990 (32% lower among men and 22% lower among women). The 50% reduction goal was more fully met for the cancer sites for which there was enactment of effective approaches for prevention, early detection, and/or treatment. Among men, mortality rates dropped for lung cancer by 45%, for colorectal cancer by 47%, and for prostate cancer by 53%. Among women, mortality rates dropped for lung cancer by 8%, for colorectal cancer by 44%, and for breast cancer by 39%. Declines in the death rates of all other cancer sites were substantially smaller (13% among men and 17% among women). The major factors that accounted for these favorable trends were progress in tobacco control and improvements in early detection and treatment. As we embark on new national cancer goals, this recent past experience should teach us that curing the cancer problem will require 2 sets of actions: making new discoveries in cancer therapeutics and more completely applying those discoveries in cancer prevention we have already made.

Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) measure quality of life, symptoms, patient functioning, and patient perceptions of care; they are essential for gaining a full understanding of cancer care and the impact of cancer on people's lives. Repeatedly captured facility-level and/or population-level PROs (PRO surveillance) could play an important role in quality monitoring and improvement, benchmarking, advocacy, policy making, and research. This article describes the rationale for PRO surveillance and the methods of the Patient Reported Outcomes Symptoms and Side Effects Study (PROSSES), which is the first PRO study to use the American College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer's Rapid Quality Reporting System to identify patients and manage study data flow. The American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute, the Commission on Cancer, and RTI International collaborated on PROSSES. PROSSES was conducted at 17 cancer programs that participated in the National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Centers Program among patients diagnosed with locoregional breast or colon cancer. The methods piloted in PROSSES were successful as demonstrated by high eligibility (93%) and response (61%) rates. Differences in clinical and demographic characteristics between respondents and nonrespondents were mostly negligible, with the exception that non-white individuals were somewhat less likely to respond. These methods were consistent across cancer centers and reproducible over time. If repeated and expanded, they could provide PRO surveillance data from patients with cancer on a national scale.

AIM: There is a paucity of data on the clinical presentation and management of cancer patients with acquired haemophilia (AH), we here report a systematic literature review on acquired haemophilia in the context of cancer. METHODS: Treatment outcomes of AH were defined as complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or no response (NR), based on inhibitor eradication, coagulation factor VIII levels and bleeding control. Reported deaths were either related to cancer or bleeding. RESULTS: Overall, 105 cases were collected and analyzed according to classification of cancer and efficacy of treatments for inhibitor and malignancy. The mean age was 68 years for both males (range 37-86 years) and females (range 43-89 years), 39 patients were female subjects and 66 were males. A solid cancer was diagnosed in 60 subjects, while 45 patients suffered a haematological malignancy. Solid cancers affected mainly males; however, the incidence of solid tumours vs haematological malignancies was not statistically significant (P = .09). Not all patients were treated for their underlying cancer, bleeding and/or inhibitor, in two cases outcome is unavailable. CR was reported in 62.1% (64/103) cases, PR in 9.7% (10/103) cases, NR with or without death was reported in 28.1% (29/103) cases. CONCLUSION: CR was best achieved when successful and complete elimination of autoantibodies occurred contemporaneously with the successful treatment of the underlying malignancy. In some cases, recurrent autoantibodies were harbingers of relapsed cancer. Type of cancer, inhibitor titer, treatments administered for bleeding control and inhibitor eradication did not significantly affect clinical outcome of analyzed cases.

BACKGROUND: A 5-tier prognostic grade group (GG) system was enacted to simplify the risk stratification of patients with prostate cancer in which Gleason scores of </=6, 3 + 4, 4 + 3, 8, and 9 or 10 are considered GG 1 through 5, respectively. The authors investigated the utility of biopsy GG for predicting long-term oncologic outcomes after radical prostatectomy in an equal-access health system. METHODS: Men who underwent prostatectomy at 1 of 6 Veterans Affairs hospitals in the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital database between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed. The prognostic ability of biopsy GG was examined using Cox models. Interactions between GG and race also were tested. RESULTS: In total, 2509 men were identified who had data available on biopsy Gleason scores, covariates, and follow-up. The cohort included men with GG 1 (909 patients; 36.2%), GG 2 (813 patients; 32.4%), GG 3 (398 patients; 15.9%), GG 4 (279 patients; 11.1%), and GG 5 (110 patients; 4.4%) prostate cancer. The cohort included 1002 African American men (41%). The median follow-up was 60 months (interquartile range, 33-90 months). Higher GG was associated with higher clinical stage, older age, more recent surgery, and surgical center (P < .001) as well as increased biochemical recurrence, secondary therapy, castration-resistant prostate cancer, metastases, and prostate cancer-specific mortality (all P < .001). There were no significant interactions with race in predicting measured outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The 5-tier GG system predicted multiple long-term endpoints after radical prostatectomy in an equal-access health system. The predictive value was consistent across races.

BACKGROUND: Sexual behavior and oral human papillomavirus (HPV) infection are risk factors for oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The effects of OSCC diagnosis and treatment on subsequent relationship stress and sexual behavior are unknown. METHODS: Incident cases of HPV-positive or HPV-negative OSCC in patients who had a partnered relationship and partners of patients with oropharyngeal cancer were eligible for a study in which surveys were administered at diagnosis and at the 6-month follow-up time point to assess relationship distress, HPV transmission and concerns about health consequences, and sexual behavior. The frequency distributions of responses, stratified by tumor HPV status, were compared at baseline and follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 262 patients with OSCC and 81 partners were enrolled. Among the patients, 142 (54.2%) had HPV-positive OSCC, and 120 (45.8%) had HPV-negative OSCC. Relationship distress was infrequently reported, and 69% of patients felt that their relationship had strengthened since the cancer diagnosis. Both HPV-positive patients (25%) and their partners (14%) reported feelings of guilt or responsibility for the diagnosis of an HPV-caused cancer. Concern over sexual, but not nonsexual, HPV transmission to partners was reported by 50%. Significant declines in the frequency of vaginal and oral sexual behaviors were reported at follow-up, regardless of tumor HPV status. From baseline to 6 months, significant increases in abstinence from vaginal sex (from 10% to 34%; P < .01) and oral sex (from 25% to 80%; P < .01) were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis and treatment of OSCC are associated with significant declines in the frequency of vaginal and oral sex, regardless of tumor HPV status. Sexual behavior is an important quality-of-life outcome to assess within clinical trials. [See related editorial on pages 000-000, this issue.] Cancer 2017. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: In this retrospective study, data from patients listed in the Korea Central Cancer Registry during 1993-2014 were analysed, to investigate the incidence and survival of second primary cancers (SPCs) after a diagnosis of primary peritoneal, epithelial ovarian, and fallopian tubal (POFT) cancer. METHODS: The standardised incidence ratio (SIR) and survival outcomes of patients with SPCs among POFT cancer survivors were analysed. RESULTS: Among 20,738 POFT cancer survivors, 798 (3.84%) developed SPCs, at an average interval of 5.50 years. SPC risk in POFT survivors (SIR, 1.29) was higher compared to the general population. The most high-risk type of SPC was leukaemia (3.07) followed by the lung and bronchus (1.80), colon (1.58), rectum and rectosigmoid junction (1.42), thyroid (1.34), and breast (1.26). In women aged < 60 years, cancer of the breast (1.30), ascending colon (2.26), and transverse colon (4.07) as SPCs increased. Up to 10 years after POFT cancer treatment, leukaemia risk increased, especially in those < 60 years, with serous histology, and with distant stage, which required aggressive chemotherapy. The median overall survival time was 12.8 years and 14.3 years in women with POFT cancer and SPCs, respectively. Thyroid and breast cancers were favourable prognostic markers among SPCs. CONCLUSIONS: The overall SPC risk increases in POFT cancer survivors, especially in those < 60 years. The cancer risk of breast and the proximal colon increase based on hereditary predisposition, while leukaemia likely develops from aggressive treatment. The median overall survival is favourable in POFT cancer survivors with SPCs.

OBJECTIVES: To synthesize knowledge on cancer risks related to hormonal contraception and to propose recommendations on contraception during treatment and after cancer. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature about hormonal contraception and cancer was conducted on PubMed/Medline and the Cochrane Library. RESULTS: Overall, there is no increase in cancer (all types together) incidence or mortality among hormonal contraceptive users. Estroprogestin combined contraceptive use is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (during use), and with a reduced risk of endometrial, ovarian, lymphatic or hematopoietic cancers that persist after discontinuation, and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer. Information on cancer risk is part of the systematic information given to patients wishing contraception. However, these data will not influence its prescription, considering the positive risk/benefit balance in women without specific cancer risk factor. Contraception is required during and after cancer treatment in every non-menopausal woman at cancer diagnosis. Specific thromboembolic, immunologic or vomiting risks due to the oncological context should be taken into account before the contraceptive choice. All hormonal contraceptives are contra-indicated after breast cancer, regardless of the delay since treatment, hormone receptor status and histological subtype. There is no data in the literature to limit hormonal or non-hormonal contraceptive use after colorectal or thyroid cancer. There was insufficient data in the literature to propose recommendations on contraceptive choice after cervical cancer, melanoma, lung cancer, tumor of the central nervous system, or after thoracic irradiation. If an emergency contraception is needed in a woman previously treated for a hormone-sensitive cancer, a non-hormonal copper intrauterine device should be preferred. CONCLUSIONS: Information on cancer risk is part of the patient's information but does not influence the prescription of contraception in the absence of any specific risk factor. Contraception should be proposed in every woman treated or previously treated for cancer. The whole context should be taken into account to choose a tailored contraception.

Recent advances have permitted successful therapeutic targeting of the immune system in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). These new immunotherapeutic targets and agents are being rapidly adopted by the oncologic community and hold considerable promise. The National Cancer Institute sponsored a Clinical Trials Planning Meeting to address the issue of how to further investigate the use of immunotherapy in patients with HNSCC. The goals of the meeting were to consider phase 2 or 3 trial designs primarily in 3 different patient populations: those with previously untreated, human papillomavirus-initiated oropharyngeal cancers; those with previously untreated, human papillomavirus-negative HNSCC; and those with recurrent/metastatic HNSCC. In addition, a separate committee was formed to develop integrative biomarkers for the clinical trials. The meeting started with an overview of key immune components and principles related to HNSCC, including immunosurveillance and immune escape. Four clinical trial concepts were developed at the meeting integrating different immunotherapies with existing standards of care. These designs were presented for implementation by the head and neck committees of the National Cancer Institute-funded National Clinical Trials Network. This article summarizes the proceedings of this Clinical Trials Planning Meeting, the purpose of which was to facilitate the rigorous development and design of randomized phase 2 and 3 immunotherapeutic trials in patients with HNSCC. Although reviews usually are published immediately after the meeting is held, this report is unique because there are now tangible clinical trial designs that have been funded and put into practice and the studies are being activated to accrual.

BACKGROUND: Although the safety of combination chemotherapy without primary tumor resection (PTR) in patients with stage IV colon cancer has been established, questions remain regarding a potential survival benefit with PTR. The objective of this study was to compare mortality rates in patients who had colon cancer with unresectable metastases who did and did not undergo PTR. METHODS: An observational cohort study was conducted among patients with unresectable metastatic colon cancer identified from the National Cancer Data Base (2003-2005). Multivariate Cox regression analyses with and without propensity score weighting (PSW) were performed to compare survival outcomes. Instrumental variable analysis, using the annual hospital-level PTR rate as the instrument, was used to account for treatment selection bias. To account for survivor treatment bias, in situations in which patients might die soon after diagnosis from different reasons, a landmark method was used. RESULTS: In the total cohort, 8641 of 15,154 patients (57%) underwent PTR, and 73.8% of those procedures (4972 of 6735) were at landmark. PTR was associated with a significant reduction in mortality using Cox regression (hazard ratio [HR], 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.44-0.47) or PSW (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0. 44-0.49). However, instrumental variable analysis revealed a much smaller effect (relative mortality rate, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.87-0.96). Although a smaller benefit was observed with the landmark method using Cox regression (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.55-0.64) and PSW (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.54-0.64), instrumental variable analysis revealed no survival benefit (relative mortality rate, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.87-1.06). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with unresectable metastatic colon cancer, after adjustment for confounder effects, PTR was not associated with improved survival compared with systemic chemotherapy; therefore, routine noncurative PTR is not recommended.

Importance: Patients given systemic treatment for testicular germ cell cancer (GCC) are at increased risk for a second malignant neoplasm (SMN). Previous studies on SMN and causes of death lacked information on the exact treatment applied or were based on patients receiving former treatment options. Objective: To evaluate the treatment-specific risks for SMN and death in a nationwide population-based cohort of patients with GCC treated with current standard regimens. Design, Setting, and Participants: This study examined a Danish nationwide cohort of 5190 men with GCC who entered the Danish Testicular Cancer database between January 1, 1984, and December 31, 2007. Treatment results were compared with a randomly sampled, age-stratified, population-based control group. Cases of gonadal and extragonadal primary were included in the nationwide cohort. The treatments were surveillance only; retroperitoneal radiotherapy (RT); bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin (BEP); or more than 1 line of treatment (MTOL). Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative incidence and hazard ratios (HRs) for SMN and death calculated by the Cox proportional hazards model were compared with those of age-matched controls. Results: The study population comprised 2804 patients with seminoma and 2386 with nonseminoma. The median follow-up was 14.4 years (interquartile range, 8.6-20.5 years). The 20-year cumulative incidence of SMN with death as a competing risk was 7.8% (surveillance), 7.6% (BEP), 13.5% (RT), 9.2% (MTOL), and 7.0% (controls). We found no increased risk for SMN after surveillance, while the HRs were 1.7 (95% CI, 1.4-2.0), 1.8 (95% CI, 1.5-2.3), and 3.7 (95% CI, 2.5-5.5), respectively, after BEP, RT, and MTOL. Mortality owing to non-GCC causes was decreased after surveillance, but increased by 1.3 times after BEP and RT and by 2.6 times after MTOL. Excess mortality due to SMN was found after BEP (HR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2), RT (HR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.5-2.9), and MTOL (HR, 5.8; 95% CI, 3.6-9.6). Conclusions and Relevance: We found no increased risk for SMN or death among patients undergoing surveillance only. The risks for SMN and death due to SMN were increased after BEP alone, RT alone, and MTOL. Approaches to define patients who might benefit from less intensive treatment are needed.

BACKGROUND: Skeletal-related events (SREs) are common complications of bone metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). To the authors' knowledge, there are limited data regarding which factors predict SREs. The authors identified risk factors for SREs in men with bone mCRPC using characteristics commonly available in the medical record. METHODS: Data from 454 patients with nonmetastatic CRPC were identified from 2 Veteran Affairs Medical Centers from 2000 through 2013. Among these men, 233 (51%) developed bone metastases during follow-up and represented the study cohort. First occurrence of an SRE was abstracted from the medical records. A stepwise multivariable Cox model was used to select the strongest predictors of time to SRE. RESULTS: The median age of the patients at the time of diagnosis of bone mCRPC was 75 years (interquartile range, 68-81 years), and there were 153 nonblack patients (66%). During follow-up (median, 7.8 months [interquartile range, 2.9-18.3 months]), 88 patients (38%) had an SRE. On univariable analysis, more recent year of metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.91), prostate-specific antigen doubling time of >/=9 months versus <9 months (HR, 0.50), and bone pain (HR, 3.34) were all found to be associated with SRE risk. On multivariable analysis, year of metastasis (HR, 0.93), biopsy Gleason score of 7 versus </=6 (HR, 1.74), radiotherapy as the primary localized treatment versus none (HR, 2.33), and bone pain (HR, 3.64) were associated with SRE risk. The area under the curve for a multivariable model based upon these risk factors was 0.744. CONCLUSIONS: The authors identified several significant predictors of SREs among men with mCRPC. In particular, men with bone pain are at high risk of an SRE. If confirmed, future trials should focus on prolonging life and reducing SRE risk in patients with mCRPC with bone pain.

The population of adult survivors of childhood cancer continues to grow as survival rates improve. Although it is well established that these survivors experience various complications and comorbidities related to their malignancy and treatment, this risk is modified by many factors that are not directly linked to their cancer history. Research evaluating the influence of patient-specific demographic and genetic factors, premorbid and comorbid conditions, health behaviors, and aging has identified additional risk factors that influence cancer treatment-related toxicity and possible targets for intervention in this population. Furthermore, although current long-term follow-up guidelines comprehensively address specific therapy-related risks and provide screening recommendations, the risk profile of the population continues to evolve with ongoing modification of treatment strategies and the emergence of novel therapeutics. To address the multifactorial modifiers of cancer treatment-related health risk and evolving treatment approaches, a patient-centered and risk-adapted approach to care that often requires a multidisciplinary team approach, including medical and behavioral providers, is necessary for this population.

BACKGROUND: Adolescents with cancer cite the opinions of others and expected impact on others as formative for their care preferences and decisions. The current study first explores how the concepts of being a good child and being a good patient may exist for adolescents with cancer and determines how adolescents describe and apply these concepts. The study then investigates parental actions and clinician behaviors perceived by adolescents with cancer as supportive in helping them to achieve their defined good child and good patient roles. METHODS: In a prospective study conducted at 2 cancer treatment centers over the course of 10 months, 40 adolescents with cancer responded to 10 open-ended questions. Semantic content analysis was used. An adolescent focus group validated the findings. RESULTS: Of the 40 participants in the current study, 39 confirmed 1 or both concepts; the good patient responses yielded 112 codes and 5 themes: cooperation, adherence, communication, self-care, and care for others. The good child responses revealed 88 codes and 7 themes: cooperation and respect, positivity, lightening others' burdens, taking treatment seriously, recognizing mutual impact, communication, and acknowledging mortality. Of 589 interview phrases, 184 (31%) depicted themes of care for others and 58 (10%) spoke of tolerating treatment in the hope of a better future for one's self or others. The benefits and challenges of living up to these definitions were discussed. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians may consider asking adolescents about their "good child" and "good patient" descriptions to learn more about the perceived roles carried by adolescents with cancer and how these roles may impact their decision making, medication adherence, and social interactions.

BACKGROUND: The frequency of delirium among patients with cancer presenting to the emergency department (ED) is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine delirium frequency and recognition by ED physicians among patients with advanced cancer presenting to the ED of The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. METHODS: The study population was a random sample of English-speaking patients with advanced cancer who presented to the ED and met the study criteria. All patients were assessed with the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) to screen for delirium and with the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS) to measure delirium severity (mild, </=15; moderate, 16-22; and severe, >/=23). ED physicians were also asked whether their patients were delirious. RESULTS: Twenty-two of the 243 enrolled patients (9%) had CAM-positive delirium, and their median MDAS score was 14 (range, 9-21 [30-point scale]). The median age of the enrolled patients was 62 years (range, 19-89 years). Patients with delirium had a poorer performance status than patients without delirium (P < .001); however, the 2 groups did not differ in other characteristics. Ten of the 99 patients who were 65 years old or older (10%) had CAM-positive delirium, whereas 12 of the 144 patients younger than 65 years (8%) did (P = .6). According to the MDAS scores, delirium was mild in 18 patients (82%) and moderate in 4 patients (18%). Physicians correctly identified delirium in 13 of the CAM-positive delirious patients (59%). CONCLUSIONS: Delirium is relatively frequent and is underdiagnosed by physicians in patients with advanced cancer who are visiting the ED. Further research is needed to identify the optimal screening tool for delirium in ED. Cancer 2016. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society. Cancer 2016;122:2918-2924. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: We examined the associations between cigarette smoking, comorbidity, and general health among survivors of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer and a comparison group. METHODS: From the 2012 to 2014 National Health Interview Surveys, we identified 1019 survivors of AYA cancer, defined as individuals who had been diagnosed with cancer between 15 and 39 years of age and were at least 5 years after their initial cancer diagnosis. A noncancer comparison group was matched on age, sex, and other factors. Self-reported smoking status (never smoker, former smoker, or current smoker), comorbidities (eg, asthma and diabetes), and general health status (excellent, very good, or good versus poor or fair) were compared among these groups. Survivors' smoking status before diagnosis and interaction with health care professionals regarding smoking cessation were reported. Multivariable logistic regressions modeled the associations between smoking status and comorbidity and general health. RESULTS: 33% of survivors were current smokers compared with 22% in the comparison group (P < .001). Prevalence of comorbidities and fair/poor health was significantly higher among survivors. Current smokers among survivors were more likely to report greater comorbidities (odds ratio [OR], 1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-2.47; P = .03) and less likely to report at least good health (OR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22-0.54; P < .001) than never-smokers. Among survivors who smoked currently, 92% started smoking before diagnosis, and 37% reported having no smoking-related discussions with health care professionals in the previous year. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking among survivors of AYA cancer is associated with greater comorbidities and poorer general health. Younger survivors may need to be targeted for effective smoking cessation interventions. Addressing cigarette smoking during medical visits may encourage survivors to quit smoking. Cancer 2016.

BACKGROUND: It has been proposed that cancer establishment, maintenance, and recurrence may be attributed to a unique population of tumor cells termed cancer-initiating cells (CICs) that may include characteristics of putative cancer stem cell-like cells. Studies in lung cancer have shown that such cells can be enriched and propagated in vitro by culturing tumor cells in serum-free suspension as tumorspheres. CICs have been characterized for their phenotype, stem cell-like qualities, and their role in establishing tumor and maintaining tumor growth. Less is known about the interaction of CICs with the immune system. METHODS: We established CIC-enriched tumorspheres from murine TC-1 lung cancer cells, expressing human papillomavirus 16 (HPV-16) E6/E7 antigens, and evaluated their susceptibility to antitumor immune responses both in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: TC-1 CICs demonstrated reduced expression of surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-I molecules compared to non-CICs. We similarly determined decreased MHC-I expression in five of six human lung cancer cell lines cultured under conditions enriching for CICs. In vivo, TC-1 cells enriched for CICs were resistant to human papillomavirus 16 E6/E7 peptide vaccine-mediated killing. We found that vaccinated mice challenged with CIC enriched tumorspheres demonstrated shorter survivals and showed significantly fewer CD8(+) tumor infiltrating lymphocytes compared to CIC non-enriched challenged mice. Furthermore, cultured cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) from vaccinated mice demonstrated reduced capacity to lyse TC-1 cells enriched for CICs compared to non-enriched TC-1 cells. Following treatment with IFN-gamma, both CIC enriched and non-enriched TC-1 cells expressed similar levels of MHC-I, and the increased MHC-I expression on CICs resulted in greater CTL-mediated tumor lysis and improved tumor-free survival in mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the attenuated expression of MHC-I molecules by CICs represents a potential strategy of CICs to escape immune recognition, and that the development of successful immunotherapy strategies targeting CICs may decrease their resistance to T cell-mediated immune detection by enhancing CIC MHC-I expression.

CONTEXT: The European Deprivation Index (EDI), is a new ecological estimate for Socio-Economic Status (SES). This study postulates that Time-To-Treatment could be used as a cancer quality-of -care surrogate in order to identify the association between cancer patient's SES and quality of care in a French comprehensive cancer center. METHODS: retrospective mono-centered cohort study. All consecutive incoming adult patients diagnosed for breast cancer (BC), prostate cancer (PC), colorectal cancer (CRC), lung cancer (LC) or sarcoma (S) were included between January 2013 and December 2013. The association of EDI and Time-To-Diagnosis (TTD), as well as Time-To-Treatment (TTT) was analyzed using a cox regression, and a strata analysis per tumor site was performed. RESULTS: 969 patients were included. Primitive tumor site was 505 BC (52%), 169 PC (17%), 145 LC (15%), 116 CRC (12%), and 34 S (4%). Median TTD was 1.41 months (Q1-Q3 0.5 to 3.5 months). Median TTT was 0.9 months (0.4 - 1.4). In a multivariate analysis, we identified the tumor site as a predictive factor to influence TTD, shorter for BC (0.75 months, [0.30- 1.9]) than PC (4.69 months [1.6-29.7]), HR 0.27 95%CI = [0.22-0.34], p < 0.001. TTT was also shorter for BC (0.75 months [0.4-1.1]) than PC (2.02 [0.9-3.2]), HR 0.32 95%CI = [0.27-0.39], p < 0.001. EDI quintiles were not found associated with either TTT or TTD. CONCLUSIONS: Deprivation estimated by the EDI does not appear to be related to an extension of the Time-to-Diagnosis or Time-to-Treatment in our real-life population. Further research should be done to identify other frailty-sensitive factors that could be responsible for delays in care.

Although circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have potential as diagnostic biomarkers for cancer, determining their prognostic role in cancer patients undergoing treatment is a challenge. We evaluated the prognostic value of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in CTCs in colorectal and prostate cancer patients undergoing treatment. Peripheral blood samples were collected from 62 metastatic colorectal cancer patients and 30 metastatic prostate cancer patients. CTCs were isolated from the samples using magnetic separation with the cell-surface vimentin(CSV)-specific 84-1 monoclonal antibody that detects epithelial-mesenchymal transitioned (EMT) CTCs. CTCs were enumerated and analyzed for PD-L1 expression using confocal microscopy. PD-L1 expression was detectable in CTCs and was localized in the membrane and/or cytoplasm and nucleus. CTC detection alone was not associated with poor progression-free or overall survival in colorectal cancer or prostate cancer patients, but nuclear PD-L1 (nPD-L1) expression in these patients was significantly associated with short survival durations. These results demonstrated that nPD-L1 has potential as a clinically relevant prognostic biomarker for colorectal and prostate cancer. Our data thus suggested that use of CTC-based models of cancer for risk assessment can improve the standard cancer staging criteria and supported the incorporation of nPD-L1 expression detection in CTCs detection in such models.

BACKGROUND: Cancer cells exhibit elevated levels of glucose uptake and may obtain pre-formed, diet-derived fatty acids from the bloodstream to boost their rapid growth; they may also use nucleic acid from their microenvironment. The study of processing nucleic acid by cancer cells will help improve the understanding of the metabolism of cancer. DNA is commonly packaged into a viral or lipid particle to be transferred into cells; this process is called transfection in laboratory. Cancer cells are known for having gene mutations and the evolving ability of endocytosis. Their uptake of DNAs might be different from normal cells; they may take in DNAs directly from the environment. In this report, we studied the uptake of DNAs in cancer cells without a transfection reagent. METHODS: A group of DNA fragments were prepared with PCR and labeled with isotope phosphorous-32 to test their uptake by Huh 7 (liver cancer) and THLE3 (normal liver cells) after incubation overnight by counting radioactivity of the cells' genomic DNA. Multiple cell lines including breast cancer and lung cancer were tested with the same method. DNA molecules were also labeled with fluorescence to test the location in the cells using a kit of "label it fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)" from Mirus (USA). RESULTS: The data demonstrated that hepatocellular carcinoma cells possess the ability to take in large DNA fragments directly without a transfection reagent whereas normal liver cells cannot. Huh7 and MDA-MB231 cells displayed a significantly higher Rhodamine density in the cytoplasmic phagosomes and this suggests that the mechanism of uptake of large DNA by cancer cells is likely endocytosis. The efficacy of uptake is related to the DNA's size. Some cell lines of lung cancer and breast cancer also showed similar uptake of DNA. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, we have revealed the evidence that some cancer cells, but not nontumorigenic cells, can take DNA fragments directly from the environment without the aid of the transfecting reagent.

BACKGROUND: Patients with advanced cancer often experience fatigue and other symptoms that negatively impact their quality of life. The current trial investigated the effect of melatonin on fatigue and other symptoms in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: Patients who were aged >/=18 years, had a histologically confirmed stage IV cancer (TNM Classification), and who reported feeling significantly tired were recruited from the palliative care unit at the study institution. The study was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Patients received 1 week of melatonin at a dose of 20 mg or a placebo orally each night, before crossing over and receiving the opposite treatment for 1 week. Between the 2 periods, a washout period of 2 days was implemented. Outcomes were measured using the Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20) and The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. Physical fatigue from the MFI-20 was the primary outcome. The primary analysis was a complete complier analysis (ie, it included only those patients who had consumed at least 5 capsules per week and who had answered the MFI-20 on days 1, 7, 10, and 17). Sensitivity analysis using multiple imputations including all randomized patients and all patients completing the intervention were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 72 patients were randomized. Fifty patients completed the intervention and 44 patients were complete compliers. No significant differences between the placebo and melatonin periods were found for physical fatigue, secondary outcomes, or explorative outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, oral melatonin at a dose of 20 mg was not found to improve fatigue or other symptoms in patients with advanced cancer.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors' disclosure of complementary health approaches (CHAs) to their follow-up care physicians is necessary to ensure the safe and optimal use of such approaches. Rates of disclosure of CHAs are variable and may be facilitated by patient-centered communication. METHODS: This cross-sectional study conducted in 2003-2004 examined a population-based sample of leukemia, colorectal, and bladder cancer survivors (n=623) who were 2 to 5 years after their diagnosis. A subset of participants who reported using CHAs (n=196) was analyzed with multivariate logistic regression to examine the association between patients' perceptions of their physician's patient-centered communication (ie, information exchange, affective behavior, knowledge of patients as persons) and patients' disclosure of CHA use to their physician with adjustments for physician, patient, and patient-physician relationship factors. RESULTS: Thirty-one percent of the full sample used CHAs, and 47.6% of CHA users disclosed their use to their physicians. Disclosure was significantly associated with patient-centered communication even with adjustments for hypothesized covariates (odds ratio [OR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.71). Perceived physician knowledge of the patient as a person (OR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.10-1.48) and information exchange (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.02-1.60) were the aspects of patient-centered communication that contributed to this association. The main reason for nondisclosure assessed in the survey was that survivors did not think that it was important to discuss CHAs (67.0%). A majority of physicians encouraged continued use of CHAs when they were disclosed (64.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Results support the idea that improving the overall patient centeredness of cancer follow-up care and improving the disclosure of CHA use are potentially synergistic clinical goals.

Cancer is usually diagnosed late in rural Africa leading to incurability and abbreviated survival. Many curable cancers present on the body surface, often recognizable early by laymen as suspicious, justifying professional referral. Cancer diagnoses in two randomly chosen Tanzanian villages were compared after conventional dispensary self-referral vs. proactive visits in the home. Village navigators organized trips for professional consultation. In the control village 21% were self-referred, 20% of them were sent on as suspicious, 78% had cancer (8% in men) 0.9% of the village population. In the intervention village 99% were screened, 14% were referred for professional opinion, 93% had cancer (32% in men) 1.6% (p < 0.01 compared with control village). In the second and third years similar activity yielded 0.5% cancer annually in the control village for a 3 year total of 1.86% whereas interventional villagers had 1.4% and 0.6% cancer for a 3 year total of 3.56% (p < 0.001). Downstaging was recognized in the second and third years of intervention from 23 to 51 to 74% Stages I and II (p < 0.001) but in the control village Stages I and II changed from 11% to 22% to 37% (p = NS). The greatest downstaging occurred in breast and cervix cancers.

BACKGROUND: The current study was conducted to investigate survival and the response to radiotherapy among patients with molecular subtypes of breast cancer brain metastases treated with or without targeted therapies. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with breast cancer brain metastases at a single tertiary care institution were included. The primary outcome was overall survival, whereas secondary outcomes included the cumulative incidences of distant intracranial failure, local failure, and radiation necrosis. Competing risks regression was used to model secondary outcomes. RESULTS: Within the study period, 547 patients presented with 3224 brain metastases and met inclusion criteria. Among patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-amplified disease, 80% received HER2 antibodies and 38% received HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The median survival was significantly shorter in the basal cohort (8.4 months), and progressively increased in the luminal A (12.3 months), HER2-positive (15.4 months), and luminal B (18.8 months) cohorts (P<.001). Among patients with HER2-amplified disease, the median survival was extended with the use of both HER2 antibodies (17.9 months vs 15.1 months; P = .04) and TKIs (21.1 months vs 15.4 months; P = .03). The 12-month cumulative incidences of local failure among molecular subtypes were 6.0% in the luminal A cohort, 10.3% in the luminal B cohort, 15.4% in the HER2-positive cohort, and 9.9% in the basal cohort (P = .01). Concurrent HER2/epidermal growth factor receptor TKIs with stereotactic radiosurgery significantly decreased the 12-month cumulative incidence of local failure from 15.1% to 5.7% (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Molecular subtypes appear to be prognostic for survival and predictive of the response to radiotherapy. TKIs were found to improve survival and local control, and may decrease the rate of distant failure. To preserve neurocognition, these results support a paradigm of upfront radiosurgery and HER2-directed therapy in the HER2-amplified population, reserving whole-brain radiotherapy for salvage.

BACKGROUND: Follow-up care is critical for childhood cancer survivors (CCS), who are at high risk for comorbidities and late effects of cancer treatments. Understanding the factors associated with maintaining follow-up care is needed, especially for Hispanic CCS, who have been under-represented in previous studies. METHODS: Risk factors and protective factors for receiving cancer-related follow-up care were examined among 193 Los Angeles County CCS diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 (54% Hispanic; mean +/- standard deviation age, 19.9 +/- 2.8 years; age at diagnosis, 12.1 +/- 3.0 years; time since diagnosis, 7.8 +/- 2.0 years). Self-report surveys were used to assess follow-up care, insurance status, demographics, clinical factors, and psychosocial risk (eg, depression) and protective (eg, self-efficacy [SE]) factors. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with the previous receipt of cancer-related follow-up care (in prior 2 years) and the intent to seek future cancer-related follow-up care. RESULTS: Seventy-three percent of CCS reported a cancer follow-up visit in the previous 2 years, which was positively associated (P < .05) with having health insurance, white ethnicity (vs Hispanic), younger age, and greater treatment intensity. Sixty-nine percent reported an intent to receive follow-up care in the next 2 years, which was positively associated (P < .05) with having health insurance and greater SE. CONCLUSIONS: Hispanics and older CCS were more likely to lack previous follow-up care. Because health insurance was strongly associated with both previous follow-up care and the intent to seek care, the current results indicate that recent changes in health coverage may improve follow-up among CCS. Interventions targeting improved SE may help increase intent to receive follow-up care for this population.

Purpose Fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is a common problem experienced by cancer survivors. Approximately one third of survivors report high FCR. This study aimed to evaluate whether blended cognitive behavior therapy (bCBT) can reduce the severity of FCR in cancer survivors curatively treated for breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer. Patients and Methods This randomized controlled trial included 88 cancer survivors with high FCR (Cancer Worry Scale score >/= 14) from 6 months to 5 years after cancer treatment. Participants were randomly allocated (ratio 1:1, stratified by cancer type) to receive bCBT, including five face-to face and three online sessions (n = 45) or care as usual (CAU; n = 43). Participants completed questionnaires at baseline (T0) and 3 months later (T1). The intervention group completed bCBT between T0 and T1. The primary outcome was FCR severity assessed with the Cancer Worry Scale. Secondary outcomes included other distress-related measures. Statistical (one-way between-group analyses of covariance) and clinical effects (clinically significant improvement) were analyzed by intention to treat. Results Participants who received bCBT reported significantly less FCR than those who received CAU (mean difference, -3.48; 95% CI, -4.69 to -2.28; P < .001) with a moderate-to-large effect size ( d = 0.76). Clinically significant improvement in FCR was significantly higher in the bCBT group than in the CAU group (13 [29%] of 45 compared with 0 [0%] of 43; P < .001); self-rated improvement was also higher in the bCBT group (30 [71%] of 42 compared with 12 [32%] of 38 in the CAU group; P < .001). Conclusion bCBT has a statistically and clinically significant effect on the severity of FCR in cancer survivors and is a promising new treatment approach.

Population ageing has substantially contributed to the rising number of new cancer cases worldwide. We document cancer incidence patterns in 2012 among older adults globally, and examine the changing magnitude of cancer in this age group over the next decades. Using GLOBOCAN 2012 data, we presented the number and proportion of new cancer cases, and the truncated age-standardised incidence rates among adults aged 65 years and older for all cancer sites combined and for the five most common cancer sites by world region. We calculated the incidence in 2035 by applying population projections, assuming no changes in rates. In 2012, 6.7 million new cancer cases (47.5% of all cancers) were diagnosed among older adults worldwide, with marked regional disparities. Nearly 48% of these cases occurred in less developed regions. Lung, colorectal, prostate, stomach and breast cancers represented 55% of the global incidence, yet distinct regional patterns were observed. We predict 14 million new cancer cases by 2035, representing almost 60% of the global cancer incidence. The largest relative increase in incidence is predicted in the Middle East and Northern Africa (+157%), and in China (+155%). Less developed regions will see an increase of new cases by 144%, compared to 54% in more developed regions. The expected increase in cancer incidence at older ages will have substantial economic and social impacts globally, posing considerable and unique challenge to healthcare systems in every world region, especially in those with limited resources and weaker health systems.

BACKGROUND: Rigorous processes ensure quality of research and clinical care at National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer centers (NCICCCs). Unmeasurable elements of structure and process of cancer care delivery warrant evaluation. To the authors' knowledge, the impact of NCICCC care on survival and access to NCICCCs for vulnerable subpopulations remain unstudied. METHODS: The current study's population-based cohort of 69,579 patients had newly diagnosed adult-onset (aged 22-65 years) cancers reported to the Los Angeles County cancer registry between 1998 and 2008. Geographic information systems were used for geospatial analysis. RESULTS: With regard to overall survival across multiple diagnoses, patients not receiving their first planned treatment at NCICCCs experienced poorer outcomes compared with those treated at NCICCCs; differences persisted on multivariable analyses after adjusting for clinical and sociodemographic factors (hepatobiliary: hazard ratio [HR], 1.5; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.4-1.7 [P<.001]; lung: HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.3-1.6 [P<.001]; pancreatic: HR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7 [P<.001]; gastric: HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.7 [P = .01]; breast: HR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5 [P<.001]; and colorectal: HR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4 [P = .05]). With regard to barriers to care, multivariable analyses revealed that a lower likelihood of treatment at NCICCCs was associated with race/ethnicity (African-American: OR range across diagnoses: 0.4-0.7 [P<.03]; Hispanic: OR range, 0.5-0.7 [P<.04]); lack of private insurance (public: OR range, 0.6-0.8 [P<.004]; uninsured: OR range, 0.1-0.5 [P<.04]); less than high socioeconomic status (high-middle: OR range, 0.4-0.7 [P<.02]; middle: OR range, 0.3-0.5 [P<.001]; and low: OR range, 0.2-0.6 [P<.01]), and residing >9 miles from the nearest NCICCC (OR range, 0.5-0.7 [P<.02]). CONCLUSIONS: Among individuals aged 22 to 65 years residing in Los Angeles County with newly diagnosed adult-onset cancer, those who were treated at NCICCCs experienced superior survival compared with those treated at non-NCICCC facilities. Barriers to care at NCICCCs included race/ethnicity, insurance, socioeconomic status, and distance to an NCICCC.

Thyroid nodules are very common, and thyroid cancer is currently the fifth leading cancer diagnosis in women. The American Thyroid Association has led the development and revision of guidelines for the management of patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). The most current revision was published in the January 2016 issue of the journal Thyroid. The current guidelines have 101 recommendations, with 8 figures and 17 tables that are hopefully helpful to those treating patients with thyroid nodules and cancer. The primary goals of the American Thyroid Association Guidelines Task Force were to use the current evidence to guide recommendations and yet be as helpful and practical as possible within the scope and strength of the evidence. The current review focuses on new and significantly revised recommendations that may very well change clinical practice. The author notes 3 new basic principles that have emerged in this guidelines revision: 1) the management of thyroid nodules, including the decision to perform a fine-needle aspiration biopsy as well as follow-up decision making, will be heavily influenced by the newly developed sonographic risk pattern; 2) the long-term management of DTC along with thyroid-stimulating hormone target goals will be heavily influenced by the 4 categories of "response to therapy"; and 3) the management of patients with radioactive iodine-refractory DTC will be divided into 4 basic decision-making groups: patients who should undergo monitoring, patients who should undergo directed therapies, patients who should undergo systemic therapies, and patients who should be offered entry into clinical trials.

INTRODUCTION: The aim of screening an asymptomatic population for cancer is to achieve better health outcomes, particularly a population survival benefit. Australia has three population screening programs: the National Cervical Screening Program (NCSP), BreastScreen Australia and the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program (NBCSP). METHODS: We reviewed the history and development of the three programs. NCSP: Women have a Pap smear every 2 years from age 18-20, or 2 years after first becoming sexually active, until age 69. Since introduction of the NCSP, the cervical cancer incidence has halved, with an approximate 60% decrease in mortality. The screening participation rate approximates 57%, but is lower for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women, women in remote areas, and women with lower socio-economic status. The National HPV (human papillomavirus) Vaccination Program, introduced in 2007, is expected to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer by a further 70% and has already reduced the incidence of high-grade lesions in girls. In 2017, testing for HPV every 5 years starting at age 25 will replace the Pap smear as the principal screening test. BreastScreen Australia: This program targets women aged 50-74. Over 20 years, mortality from breast cancer has decreased by 32% in response to screening and treatment advances. The participation rate is 56%. The major adverse impact of breast screening is overdiagnosis, estimated in Australia to be as low as 8% of detected cancers, but with estimates of up to 30% from some research. Women should be made aware of both the potential benefits and harms from screening. Genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in high-risk women leads to earlier screening. NBCSP: The NBCSP uses immunochemical faecal occult blood test (iFOBT) kits on stool samples to detect bleeding from the bowel. When rollout is complete in 2020, test kits will be sent every 2 years to people aged 50-74. People who test positive are followed up with a colonoscopy. The participation rate is currently 37%. The positivity rate is 7%, and stage 1 bowel cancer presentations have tripled since the program began. CONCLUSIONS: Research needs to focus on reducing mortality through increased screening participation and, in the future, obtaining guidance for customised screening from genomic testing.

The lifestyle factors of physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and diet are increasingly being studied for their associations with cancer. Physical activity is inversely associated with and sedentary behaviour is positively (and independently) associated with an increased risk of more than ten types of cancer, including colorectal cancer (and advanced adenomas), endometrial cancers, and breast cancer. The most consistent dietary risk factor for premalignant and invasive breast cancer is alcohol, whether consumed during early or late adult life, even at low levels. Epidemiological studies show that the inclusion of wholegrain, fibre, fruits, and vegetables within diets are associated with reduced cancer risk, with diet during early life (age <8 years) having the strongest apparent association with cancer incidence. However, randomised controlled trials of diet-related factors have not yet shown any conclusive associations between diet and cancer incidence. Obesity is a key contributory factor associated with cancer risk and mortality, including in dose-response associations in endometrial and post-menopausal breast cancer, and in degree and duration of fatty liver disease-related hepatocellular carcinoma. Obesity produces an inflammatory state, characterised by macrophages clustered around enlarged hypertrophied, dead, and dying adipocytes, forming crown-like structures. Increased concentrations of aromatase and interleukin 6 in inflamed breast tissue and an increased number of macrophages, compared with healthy tissue, are also observed in women with normal body mass index, suggesting a metabolic obesity state. Emerging randomised controlled trials of physical activity and dietary factors and mechanistic studies of immunity, inflammation, extracellular matrix mechanics, epigenetic or transcriptional regulation, protein translation, circadian disruption, and interactions of the multibiome with lifestyle factors will be crucial to advance this field.

PURPOSE: Many long-term cancer survivors still have to adjust to possible adverse consequences of the illness or treatment. Resources can play an important role in this adjustment process, but research on this topic is limited, especially for very long-term survivors. This study explores, which resources are most frequently indicated by different subgroups of cancer survivors, and what role resources play for functioning and health-related quality of life (HRQL) in cancer survivors with and without recurrence. METHODS: The sample of 6030 breast, colorectal, and prostate cancer survivors (5-16 years post-diagnosis) was recruited in a German multi-regional population-based study. Personal resources were assessed by a 27-item checklist; HRQL was assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). General linear models were used to analyze associations of resources with HRQL. RESULTS: Participants indicated on average 11.4 (SD 5.1) resources as helpful. Family, activities with others, and partnership were indicated most commonly overall, but frequencies varied according to age, sex, and tumor site. Physical activity, health, professional help, calmness, hope, optimism, and hobbies were most important in explaining HRQL variance. Cancer survivors with recurrence and many resources were found to report similar HRQL as survivors without recurrence and only few resources. CONCLUSIONS: The study underlines the importance and situational variability of personal and social resources for cancer survivors' HRQL, even years post-diagnosis. Not only the availability, but also the individual perception and significance of resources should be considered in follow-up cancer care.

BACKGROUND: Metachronous cancer in patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) is common and is associated with a poor prognosis. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of metachronous cancer at different sites according to age at diagnosis of index HNC. METHODS: We collected data on 2011 patients with oral cancer, oropharynx cancer, hypopharyngeal cancer, and laryngeal cancer as index cancers using the Osaka International Cancer Institute Cancer Registry database between 2005 and 2016. Among these, we analyzed 1953 patients after excluding 5 patients who were not followed-up and 53 patients with simultaneous multiple index cancers. We evaluated the cumulative incidence of metachronous cancer in the esophagus, lung, and other sites according to age at diagnosis of the index HNC using the Kaplan-Meier method. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors that influenced the incidence of metachronous cancers following HNC. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of metachronous esophageal cancer in young patients (< 65 years) was significantly higher than that in old patients (>/= 65 years) (12.1% vs 8.5% at 5 years, and 16.5% vs 11.2% at 10 years; p = 0.015). On the other hand, the cumulative incidence of the other cancers in young patients was significantly lower than that in old patients (7.8% vs 12.2% at 5 years, and 13.9% vs 15.3% at 10 years; p = 0.017). The cumulative incidence of lung cancer was not significance according to age at diagnosis of the index HNC. In the multivariate analysis, histological type (squamous cell carcinoma) and lesion location (hypopharynx and larynx) were independently associated with metachronous cancers. Moreover, age at diagnosis of the index HNC (< 65 years), histological type (squamous cell carcinoma) and lesion location (hypopharynx) were significant predictors of metachronous esophageal cancer incidence and lesion location (hypopharynx) was a significant predictor of metachronous lung cancer incidence. CONCLUSION: Risk stratification of metachronous cancers with age and other predictors may help to properly manage patients with HNC. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The present study is a non-intervention trial.

BACKGROUND: The Canadian health care system provides equitable access to equivalent standards of care. The authors investigated to determine whether patients with breast cancer who had different socioeconomic status (SES) received different care and had different overall survival (OS) in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: Women who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 2004 and 2009 were identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry and linked to provincial databases to ascertain patient demographics, screening, diagnosis, treatment patterns, and survival. SES was defined as neighborhood income by postal code and was divided into income quintiles (Q1-Q5; with Q5 the highest SES quintile). Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to examine the associations between: 1) SES and mammogram screening and breast cancer treatments, and 2) SES and OS. RESULTS: In total, 34,776 patients with breast cancer who had information on disease stage available at diagnosis were identified. Seventy-six percent of women were aged >50 years. Patients with higher SES were more likely to be diagnosed at an earlier stage (Q5 [44.3%] vs Q1 [37.7%]; odds ratio [OR], 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.41; P < .0001) and also were more likely to receive adjuvant chemotherapy (Q5 vs Q1: OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.10-1.26; P < .0001) and radiotherapy (Q5 vs Q1: OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.15-1.33; P < .0001). The 5-year OS rates for Q1 through Q5 were 80%, 81%, 82.2%, 83.9%, and 85.7%, respectively (P < .0001). After adjusting for patient demographics, cancer stage at diagnosis, adjuvant chemotherapy, trastuzumab, radiotherapy and surgery types, higher SES remained associated with better OS (P = .0017). CONCLUSIONS: In a universal health care system, higher SES is associated with greater screening and treatments and with better OS after adjusting for screening, cancer stage at diagnosis, and treatments.

CONTEXT: In vitro and in vivo experiments have assigned both oncosuppressive and oncogenic properties to thyroid hormones. Population-based studies have found inconclusive results. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to prospectively assess the relation between thyroid function and incident cancer in a population-based setting. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The current study is a prospective population-based cohort study including 10 318 participants for whom baseline measurements of free T4 (FT4) and/or TSH were available. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess hazard ratios (HRs) of any solid non-skin cancer, as well as lung, breast, prostate, and gastrointestinal cancer specifically. RESULTS: Higher FT4 levels were associated with a higher risk of any solid cancer (HR, 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.79), lung cancer (HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 1.39-3.92) and breast (HR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.10-2.84) cancer. The risk estimates were similar after exclusion of thyroid-altering medication, but the association lost significance for breast cancer. Compared with the lowest FT4 tertile, the highest tertile was associated with a 1.13-fold increased risk of any solid, 1.79-fold increased risk of lung, and 1.14-fold increased risk of breast cancer (P for trend <.05 for all). For TSH levels we found no associations with cancer risk. There was no differential effect of sex or age on the association between thyroid function and cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Higher FT4 levels are significantly associated with an increased risk of any solid, lung, and breast cancer. Further research should elucidate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Insomnia affects between 30% to 60% of patients with cancer but to the authors' knowledge little is known regarding factors associated with its development. It has been postulated that adjuvant cancer treatments and their side effects could trigger sleep disturbances in this population but empirical evidence is lacking. The goal of the current study was to assess, separately in patients with breast and prostate cancer, the effect of adjuvant treatments on the evolution of insomnia symptoms and the mediating role of somatic symptoms. METHODS: As part of a population-based epidemiological study, patients with breast cancer (465 patients) and prostate cancer (263 patients) completed at baseline (perioperative period) and 2 months, 6 months, 10 months, 14 months, and 18 months later the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and a questionnaire assessing various somatic symptoms. RESULTS: In patients with breast cancer, radiotherapy (overall effect) and chemotherapy (at 2 months), but not hormone therapy, were associated with increased insomnia severity, whereas androgen deprivation therapy was related to increased insomnia in patients with prostate cancer. In patients with breast cancer, the effect of chemotherapy and radiotherapy on insomnia was found to be significantly mediated by a variety of somatic symptoms, whereas night sweats had a particularly marked mediating role for hormone therapy, both in patients with breast and prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study indicate that cancer treatments and their side effects contribute to the aggravation of insomnia symptoms. Side effects of cancer treatments should be monitored more closely and managed as effectively as possible to prevent the occurrence or aggravation of insomnia.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this phase 1 and 2 trial was to identify the appropriate dose of combined carboplatin and pralatrexate for patients with recurrent, platinum-sensitive ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer. METHODS: In phase 1, patients received carboplatin (at an area under the curve of 5) and increasing doses of pralatrexate until the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of pralatrexate was achieved. The primary endpoint was the response rate. Additional endpoints were safety, response duration, progression-free survival, overall survival, and pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Thirty patients were enrolled in phase 1, and 20 were enrolled in phase 2. Of all 50 patients, 49 completed the study. The mean patient age was 59 years, and patients completed a median of 6 cycles. The MTD for pralatrexate was 105 mg/m(2) . The clinical benefit rate (complete responses plus partial responses plus stable disease) was 86%. Of 26 patients who received the MTD, 12 had a partial response, 11 had stable disease, and 2 had disease progression. The progression-free survival rate at 3 and 6 months was 87% and 79%, respectively; and the overall survival rate was 98% at 6 and 12 months and 66% at 24 months. Of 30 patients, 18 (60%) in phase 1 experienced an adverse event of any grade; and, of those, 4 patients (13%) had a grade 3 or greater adverse event. In phase 2, 12 patients (60%) had an adverse event of any grade, and 4 (20%) had grade 3 or greater toxicity. There was a significant reduction in the total body clearance of pralatrexate when it was received concurrently with carboplatin. CONCLUSIONS: Most patients responded to carboplatin-pralatrexate combination. This regimen is well tolerated and effective in this patient population. Cancer 2016;122:3297-3306.

OBJECTIVE: When using area-level disadvantage measures, size of geographic unit can have major effects on recorded socioeconomic cancer disparities. This study examined the extent of changes in recorded socioeconomic inequalities in cancer survival and distant stage when the measure of socioeconomic disadvantage was based on smaller Census Collection Districts (CDs) instead of Statistical Local Areas (SLAs). METHODS: Population-based New South Wales Cancer Registry data were used to identify cases diagnosed with primary invasive cancer in 2000-2008 (n=264,236). Logistic regression and competing risk regression modelling were performed to examine socioeconomic differences in odds of distant stage and hazard of cancer death for all sites combined and separately for breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancers. RESULTS: For all sites collectively, associations between socioeconomic disadvantage and cancer survival and distant stage were stronger when the CD-based socioeconomic disadvantage measure was used compared with the SLA-based measure. The CD-based measure showed a more consistent socioeconomic gradient with a linear upward trend of risk of cancer death/distant stage with increasing socioeconomic disadvantage. Site-specific analyses provided similar findings for the risk of death but less consistent results for the likelihood of distant stage. CONCLUSIONS: The use of socioeconomic disadvantage measure based on the smallest available spatial unit should be encouraged in the future. Implications for public health: Disadvantage measures based on small spatial units can more accurately identify socioeconomic cancer disparities to inform priority settings in service planning.

AIM: To determine the prevalence and characteristics of additional primary malignancies in gastric cancer (GC) patients. METHODS: GC patients (862 total; 570 men, 292 women; mean age 59.8 +/- 12.8 years) diagnosed at the Department of Gastroenterology at Pomeranian Medical University over a period of 23 years were included in this retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database. Mean follow-up time was 31.3 +/- 38.6 mo (range 1-241 mo). The following clinicopathological features of patients with synchronous tumors were compared to those with metachronous tumors: age, sex, symptom duration, family history of cancer, tumor site, stage (early vs advanced), histology, and blood group. GC patients with and without a second tumor were compared in terms of the same clinicopathological features. RESULTS: Of 862 GC patients, 58 (6.7%) developed a total of 62 multiple primary tumors, of which 39 (63%) were metachronous and 23 (37%) synchronous. Four (6.9%) of the 58 multiple GC patients developed two or more neoplasms. The predominant tumor type of the secondary neoplasms was colorectal (n = 17), followed by lung (n = 9), breast (n = 8), and prostate (n = 7). Age was the only clinicopathological feature that differed between GC patients with synchronous vs metachronous malignancies; GC patients with synchronous neoplasms were older than those with metachronous neoplasms (68.0 +/- 10.3 years vs 59.9 +/- 11.1 years, respectively, P = 0.008). Comparisons between patients with and without a second primary cancer revealed that the only statistically significant differences were in age and blood group. The mean age of the patients with multiple GC was higher than that of those without a second primary tumor (63.4 +/- 11.4 years vs 59.5 +/- 13.0 years, respectively, P = 0.026). GC patients with a second primary tumor were more commonly blood group O than those without (56.2% vs 31.6%, respectively, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: GC patients may develop other primary cancers; appropriate preoperative and postoperative diagnostic modalities are thus required, particularly if patients are older and blood group O.

BACKGROUND: Measuring patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is becoming an integral component of quality improvement initiatives, clinical care, and research studies in cancer, including comparative effectiveness research. However, the number of PROs limits comparability across studies. Herein, the authors attempted to link the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General Physical Well-Being (FACT-G PWB) subscale with the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function (PF) calibrated item bank. The also sought to augment a subset of the conceptually most similar FACT-G PWB items with PROMIS PF items to improve the linking. METHODS: Baseline data from 5506 participants in the Measuring Your Health (MY-Health) study were used to identify the optimal items for linking FACT-G PWB with PROMIS PF. A mixed methods approach identified the optimal items for creating the 5-item FACT/PROMIS-PF5 scale. Both the linked and augmented relationships were cross-validated using the follow-up MY-Health data. RESULTS: A 5-item FACT-G PWB item subset was found to be optimal for linking with PROMIS PF. In addition, a 2-item subset, including only items that were conceptually very similar to the PROMIS item bank content, were augmented with 3 PROMIS PF items. This new FACT/PROMIS-PF5 provided superior score recovery. CONCLUSIONS: The PROMIS PF metric allows for the evaluation of the extent to which similar questionnaires can be linked and therefore expressed on the same metric. These results allow for the aggregation of existing data and provide an optimal measure for future studies wishing to use the FACT yet also report on the PROMIS PF metric. Cancer 2018;124:153-60.

BACKGROUND: Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. This study reports ovarian cancer survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis using data from the CONCORD-2 study, the largest and most geographically comprehensive, population-based survival study to date. METHODS: Data from women diagnosed with ovarian cancer between 2001 and 2009 from 37 states, covering 80% of the US population, were used in all analyses. Survival was estimated up to 5 years and was age standardized and adjusted for background mortality (net survival) using state-specific and race-specific life tables. RESULTS: Among the 172,849 ovarian cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2009, more than one-half were diagnosed at distant stage. Five-year net survival was 39.6% between 2001 and 2003 and 41% between 2004 and 2009. Black women had consistently worse survival compared with white women (29.6% from 2001-2003 and 31.1% from 2004-2009), despite similar stage distributions. Stage-specific survival for all races combined between 2004 and 2009 was 86.4% for localized stage, 60.9% for regional stage, and 27.4% for distant stage. CONCLUSIONS: The current data demonstrate a large and persistent disparity in ovarian cancer survival among black women compared with white women in most states. Clinical and public health efforts that ensure all women who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer receive appropriate, guidelines-based treatment may help to decrease these disparities. Future research that focuses on the development of new methods or modalities to detect ovarian cancer at early stages, when survival is relatively high, will likely improve overall US ovarian cancer survival.

BACKGROUND: Stomach cancer was a leading cause of cancer-related deaths early in the 20th century and has steadily declined over the last century in the United States. Although incidence and death rates are now low, stomach cancer remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in black, Asian and Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native populations. METHODS: Data from the CONCORD-2 study were used to analyze stomach cancer survival among males and females aged 15 to 99 years who were diagnosed in 37 states covering 80% of the US population. Survival analyses were corrected for background mortality using state-specific and race-specific (white and black) life tables and age-standardized using the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Net survival is presented up to 5 years after diagnosis by race (all, black, and white) for 2001 through 2003 and 2004 through 2009 to account for changes in collecting Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Summary Stage 2000 data from 2004. RESULTS: Almost one-third of stomach cancers were diagnosed at a distant stage among both whites and blacks. Age-standardized 5-year net survival increased between 2001 to 2003 and 2004 to 2009 (26.1% and 29%, respectively), and no differences were observed by race. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival estimates were 53.1%, 33.8%, and 29%, respectively. Survival improved in most states. Survival by stage was 64% (local), 28.2% (regional), and 5.3% (distant). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate high fatality for stomach cancer, especially soon after diagnosis. Although improvements in stomach cancer survival were observed, survival remained relatively low for both blacks and whites. Primary prevention through the control of well-established risk factors would be expected to have the greatest impact on further reducing deaths from stomach cancer. Cancer 2017;123:4994-5013.

BACKGROUND: Worldwide, liver cancer is a leading cause of death for both men and women. The number of Americans who are diagnosed with and die of liver cancer has been rising slowly each year. Using data from the CONCORD-2 study, this study examined population-based survival by state, race, and stage at diagnosis. METHODS: Data from 37 statewide registries, which covered 81% of the US population, for patients diagnosed during 2001-2009 were analyzed. Survival up to 5 years was adjusted for background mortality (net survival) with state- and race-specific life tables, and it was age-standardized with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. RESULTS: Liver cancer was diagnosed overall more often at the localized stage, with blacks being more often diagnosed at distant and regional stages than whites. 5-year net survival was 12.2% in 2001-2003 and 14.8% in 2004-2009. Whites had higher survival than blacks in both calendar periods (11.7% vs 9.1% and 14.3% vs 11.4%, respectively). During 2004-2009, 5-year survival was 25.7% for localized-stage disease, 9.5% for regional-stage disease, and 3.5% for distant-stage disease. CONCLUSIONS: Some progress has occurred in survival for patients with liver cancer, but 5-year survival remains low, even for those diagnosed at the localized stage. Efforts directed at controlling well-established risk factors such as hepatitis B may have the greatest impact on reducing the burden of liver cancer in the United States. Cancer 2017;123:5059-78.

We designed a phase I trial to investigate the safety, immune responses and clinical benefits of a five-peptide cancer vaccine in combination with chemotherapy. Study subjects were patients positive for HLA-A2402 with locally advanced, metastatic, and/or recurrent gastrointestinal, lung or cervical cancer. Eighteen patients including nine cases of colorectal cancer were treated with escalating doses of cyclophosphamide 4days before vaccination. Five HLA-A2402-restricted, tumor-associated antigen (TAA) epitope peptides from KOC1, TTK, URLC10, DEPDC1 and MPHOSPH1 were injected weekly for 4weeks. Treatment was well tolerated without any adverse events above grade 3. Analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes showed that the number of regulatory T cells dropped from baseline after administration of cyclophosphamide and confirmed that TAA-specific T cell responses were associated significantly with longer overall survival. This phase I clinical trial demonstrated safety and promising immune responses that correlated with vaccine-induced T-cell responses. Therefore, this approach warrants further clinical studies.

While enhanced platelet activation may drive cancer progression and metastases, less is known about its role in early cancer development. Thus, we evaluated whether pre-diagnostic biomarkers of platelet activation and coagulation are related to the risks of common cancers in the prospective EPIC-Heidelberg Study using a case-cohort design. Levels of fibrinogen, soluble glycoprotein (sGP) IIb/IIIa, soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin), soluble thrombomodulin (sTM), and thrombopoietin (TPO) were measured in baseline plasma samples of a random subcohort (n = 2,480) and incident cases of breast (n = 605), prostate (n = 543), and colorectal cancer (n = 249). Multivariable Cox regression models revealed no statistically significant associations between biomarker concentrations and any of the cancer endpoints. Subgroup analyses showed a significant inverse relationship between TPO and colorectal cancer among men, with a hazard ratio (HR, highest vs. lowest quartile) of 0.60 (95% confidence interval: 0.37,0.95), whereas no significant association was observed among women. With regard to fibrinogen levels and breast cancer risk, there was a significant positive association among nulliparous women (HR: 2.53 [95% CI: 1.21, 5.30]), but not among parous women. Overall, our data suggest that enhanced platelet activation and a pro-coagulative state may not be related to increased risks of common cancers, although studies on other potential biomarkers of platelet activation and further cancer types are needed. Findings from our subgroup analyses require further investigation, as potential underlying mechanisms are not known.

BACKGROUND: Patterns of poor nutritional intake may exacerbate the elevated morbidity experienced by cancer survivors. It remains unclear whether cancer survivors adhere to existing dietary guidelines and whether survivors' diets differ from those of individuals without cancer over the long term. METHODS: The authors evaluated dietary intake and quality in 1533 adult cancer survivors who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 1999 to 2010 compared with dietary intake and quality in 3075 individuals who had no history of cancer and were matched to the cancer survivors by age, sex, and race/ethnicity. Dietary intake was assessed using 24-hour dietary recalls. The 2010 Healthy Eating Index (HEI-2010) was used to evaluate diet quality. RESULTS: The mean +/- standard deviation HEI-2010 total score was 47.2 +/- 0.5 in the cancer survivors and 48.3 +/- 0.4 in the noncancer group (P = .03). Compared with the noncancer group, cancer survivors had a significantly lower score for empty calories (13.6 vs 14.4; P = .001), which corresponded to worse adherence to dietary intake of calories from solid fats, alcohol, and added sugars. Cancer survivors also had significantly lower dietary intake of fiber than the noncancer group (15.0 vs 15.9 g per day; P = .02). In relation to recommended intake, survivors' mean dietary intake of vitamin D, vitamin E, potassium, fiber, and calcium was 31%, 47%, 55%, 60%, and 73%, respectively; whereas their mean dietary intake of saturated fat and sodium was 112% and 133%, respectively, of the recommended intake. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors had poor adherence to the US Department of Agriculture 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, and their intake patterns were worse than those in the general population for empty calories and fiber.

BACKGROUND: Reducing breast cancer incidence and achieving equity in breast cancer outcomes remains a priority for public health practitioners, health care providers, policy makers, and health advocates. Monitoring breast cancer survival can help evaluate the effectiveness of health services, quantify inequities in outcomes between states or population subgroups, and inform efforts to improve the effectiveness of cancer management and treatment. METHODS: We analyzed breast cancer survival using individual patient records from 37 statewide registries that participated in the CONCORD-2 study, covering approximately 80% of the US population. Females were diagnosed between 2001 and 2009 and were followed through December 31, 2009. Age-standardized net survival at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years after diagnosis was estimated by state, race (white, black), stage at diagnosis, and calendar period (2001-2003 and 2004-2009). RESULTS: Overall, 5-year breast cancer net survival was very high (88.2%). Survival remained remarkably high from 2001 through 2009. Between 2001 and 2003, survival was 89.1% for white females and 76.9% for black females. Between 2004 and 2009, survival was 89.6% for white females and 78.4% for black females. CONCLUSIONS: Breast cancer survival was more than 10 percentage points lower for black females than for white females, and this difference persisted over time. Reducing racial disparities in survival remains a challenge that requires broad, coordinated efforts at the federal, state, and local levels. Monitoring trends in breast cancer survival can highlight populations in need of improved cancer management and treatment. Cancer 2017;123:5100-18. Published 2017.

BACKGROUND: Risk stratification of patients with urothelial carcinoma of the bladder (UCB) after cystectomy has important clinical and research implications. The authors assessed the relative effect of tumor stage and lymph node status on cancer-specific survival (CSS) after cystectomy and developed a simplified risk-assessment tool. METHODS: In total, 14,828 patients who underwent cystectomy with lymph node dissection for UCB were identified from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (1988-2011). The relative importance of tumor stage and lymph node status with regard to CSS was assessed using stratified Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional-hazards analyses. The patients were split randomly into development and validation cohorts. Additional validation using overall survival was performed on 19,362 patients from the National Cancer Data Base. The Cancer of Bladder Risk Assessment (COBRA) tool was created using a Cox model incorporating age, tumor stage, and lymph node density. Performance was validated using observed versus expected survival plots and the Harrell concordance index. RESULTS: Patients with muscle invasive (T2), lymph node-positive disease had a survival curve similar to that in patients with extravesical (T3 and T4), lymph node-negative disease (2-year CSS, 67% and 70%, respectively). Each point increase in the COBRA score (range, 0-7) was associated with a 1.61-fold increase (95% confidence interval, 1.56-fold to 1.65-fold increase) in the risk of bladder cancer death in the development cohort. The model accurately stratified patients across risk levels in the development cohort and the 2 validation cohorts (C-index, 0.712, 0.705, and 0.68, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The COBRA score offers a straightforward, validated risk-stratification tool that incorporates the relative contribution of tumor stage and lymph node involvement to patient prognosis after cystectomy for UCB.

BACKGROUND: Conservative management of aggressive prostate cancer in the elderly without definitive therapy has been associated with a 10-year prostate cancer-specific mortality of approximately 50%. The authors examined the prevalence of definitive therapy in elderly patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease. METHODS: 411,343 patients who were diagnosed from 2004 through 2012 with intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer were identified in the National Cancer Database. Multivariable logistic regression adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics and comorbidity was used to examine the association between age and receipt of definitive therapy, defined as radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy, and of primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) among patients who did not receive definitive therapy. RESULTS: In total, 87.1% of high-risk patients and 91.9% of intermediate-risk patients received definitive therapy. When stratified by age, 93.7%, 92.1%, 90.8%, 87.6%, 80.9%, and 55.2% of high-risk patients and 96.1%, 94.7%, 93.4%, 89.7%, 82.7%, and 62.8% of intermediate-risk patients ages <60, 60 to 64, 65 to 69, 70 to 74, 75 to 79, and >/=80 years received definitive therapy, respectively. For both high-risk and intermediate-risk patients, increasing age was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving definitive therapy overall (both P < .001) and a greater likelihood of receiving primary ADT among those who did not receive definitive therapy (both P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Older age was significantly associated with a decreased likelihood of receiving definitive therapy and an increased likelihood of receiving primary ADT in this national cohort of patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk prostate cancer. Notably, approximately 40% to 45% of patients aged >/=80 years did not receive definitive therapy. These findings are alarming given the dismal outcomes of conservatively managed unfavorable-risk prostate cancer. Cancer 2017;123:4832-40. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

PURPOSE: The semantics of defining cancer cachexia over the last decade has resulted in uncertainty as to the prevalence. This has further hindered the recognition and subsequent treatment of this condition. Following the consensus definition for cancer cachexia in 2011, there is now a need to establish estimates of prevalence. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study was to assess the prevalence of cachexia in an unselected cancer population. A secondary aim was to assess patient-perceived need of attention to cachexia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study in hospital patients was undertaken. Key inclusion criteria were the following: age > 18 years, cancer diagnosis, and no surgery the preceding 24 h. Data on demographics, disease, performance status, symptoms, cachexia, and patients' perceived need of attention to weight loss and nutrition were registered. RESULTS: Data were available on 386 of 426 eligible patients. Median age (IQR) was 65 years (56-72), 214 (55%) were male and 302 (78%) had a performance status of 0-1 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group). Prevalence of cachexia (inpatients/outpatients) was 51/22%. Prevalence was highest in patients with gastrointestinal cancer (62/42%) and lung cancer (83/36%). There was no major difference in prevalence between patients with metastatic (55/24%) and localized disease (47/19%). Twenty percent of inpatients and 15% of outpatients wanted more attention to weight loss and nutrition. Cachexia (p < 0.001), symptoms of mood disorder (p < 0.001), and male gender (p < 0.01) were independently associated with increased need of attention. CONCLUSION: Cachexia is a prevalent condition, affecting both patients with localized and metastatic cancer. Clinical attention to the condition is a sizeable unmet need.

The MDM2 promoter region contains several polymorphisms, some of which have been associated with MDM2 expression, cancer risk and age at cancer onset. del1518 (rs3730485) is an indel polymorphism residing in the MDM2 promoter P1 and is in almost complete linkage disequilibrium with the MDM2 promoter P2 polymorphism SNP309T>G (rs2279744). Cancer risk assessments of del1518 have previously been conducted in relatively small Chinese populations only. In this study we assessed the genotype distribution of del1518 among healthy Caucasians, African Americans and Chinese, and we estimated the Odds Ratios (OR) for incident cancer of the breast, colon, lung and prostate (n=7,081) as compared to controls (n=3,749) in a large Caucasian (Norwegian) cohort.We found the genotypes of the del1518 to vary significantly between healthy Caucasians, African-Americans and Chinese (p< 1x10-5). Further, we found a positive association of the del1518 del-allele with risk of colon cancer (dominant model: OR = 1.15; 95 % CI = 1.01 - 1.31). Stratifying according to SNP309 status, this association remained among carriers of the SNP309TG genotype (OR = 1.21; 95 % CI = 1.01 - 1.46), but with no clear association among carriers of the SNP309TT genotype. In conclusion, our findings suggest del1518 to be associated with increased risk of colon cancer.

Tobacco smoke is an established carcinogen, but the association between tobacco smoking and cancer risk in BRCA mutation carriers is not clear. The aim of this study was to evaluate prospectively the association between tobacco smoking and cancer incidence in a cohort of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers. The study population consisted of unaffected BRCA mutation carriers. Information on lifestyle including smoking histories, reproductive factors, and past medical histories was obtained through questionnaires. Incident cancers were updated biennially via follow-up questionnaires. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using time-dependent Cox regression models. There were 700 incident cancers diagnosed over 26,711 person-years of follow-up. The most frequent cancers seen in BRCA mutation carriers were breast (n = 428; 61%) and ovarian (n = 109; 15%) cancer. Compared to nonsmokers, (ever) smoking was associated with a modest increased risk of all cancers combined (HR = 1.17; 95%CI 1.01-1.37). Women in the highest group of total pack-years (4.3-9.8) had an increased risk of developing any cancer (HR = 1.27; 95%CI 1.04-1.56), breast cancer (HR = 1.33, 95%CI 1.02-1.75), and ovarian cancer (HR = 1.68; 95%CI 1.06-2.67) compared to never smokers. The associations between tobacco smoking and cancer did not differ by BRCA mutation type or by age at diagnosis. This prospective study suggests that tobacco smoking is associated with a modest increase in the risks of breast and ovarian cancer among women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation.

Literature regarding the development of adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer programs has been dominantly informed by pediatric centers and practitioners. However, the majority of young adults are seen and treated at adult cancer centers, in which cancer volumes afford the development of innovative supportive care services. Although the supportive care services in adult cancer centers are helpful to AYAs, some of the most prominent and distinct issues faced by AYAs are not adequately addressed through these services alone. This article describes how the AYA Program at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre has collaborated with existing supportive care services in addition to supplying its own unique services to meet the comprehensive needs of AYAs in the domains of: symptom management (sexuality and fatigue), behavior modification (return to work and exercise), and health services (advanced cancer and survivorship). These collaborations are augmented by patient education interventions and timely referrals. The objective of this article was to assist other centers in expanding existing services to address the needs of AYA patients with cancer.

BACKGROUND: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening and concomitant treatment can be implemented in several ways. The authors investigated how the net benefit of PSA screening varies between common practice versus "good practice." METHODS: Microsimulation screening analysis (MISCAN) was used to evaluate the effect on quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) if 4 recommendations were followed: limited screening in older men, selective biopsy in men with elevated PSA, active surveillance for low-risk tumors, and treatment preferentially delivered at high-volume centers. Outcomes were compared with a base model in which annual screening started at ages 55 to 69 years and were simulated using data from the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer. RESULTS: In terms of QALYs gained compared with no screening, for 1000 screened men who were followed over their lifetime, recommended good practice led to 73 life-years (LYs) and 74 QALYs gained compared with 73 LYs and 56 QALYs for the base model. In contrast, common practice led to 78 LYs gained but only 19 QALYs gained, for a greater than 75% relative reduction in QALYs gained from unadjusted LYs gained. The poor outcomes for common practice were influenced predominantly by the use of aggressive treatment for men with low-risk disease, and PSA testing in older men also strongly reduced potential QALY gains. CONCLUSIONS: Commonly used PSA screening and treatment practices are associated with little net benefit. Following a few straightforward clinical recommendations, particularly greater use of active surveillance for low-risk disease and reducing screening in older men, would lead to an almost 4-fold increase in the net benefit of prostate cancer screening.

Impaired ovarian function and menopausal symptoms are common after cancer treatment. Menopausal symptoms often occur at an earlier age in women with cancer, and may be more severe than in natural menopause; they may be the most persistent and troubling sequelae of cancer. A third of female patients with cancer report dissatisfaction with the quality and length of physician-patient discussions about reproductive health, including menopause. Systemic menopausal hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, but it is not suitable for all patients after cancer - where it is unsuitable, alternative effective non-hormonal treatments are available. Effective pharmacological agents available to treat vasomotor symptoms include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, clonidine and gabapentin. There is increasing evidence supporting cognitive behavioural therapy for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, in self-help or group settings. Vaginal atrophy can be treated with vaginal (topical) oestrogen with minimal systemic absorption; topical vaginal lubricants may help with vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, with some evidence suggesting that silicone-based products may be more effective than water-based ones. Bone health may be impaired in post-menopausal women with cancer or in cancer survivors, particularly in women with treatment-related menopause or in women receiving anti-oestrogen therapies; this should be managed in addition to menopausal symptoms. Primary care physicians should be aware of the troublesome and ongoing nature of menopausal symptoms after cancer, should discuss them with all patients after cancer treatment, and should consider treatment or referral to a specialist for appropriate management.

Obesity is a risk factor of cancer. Several genes have been found to play an important role in aetiology of obesity and tumourigenesis. Recently, some studies suggested that rs9939609 polymorphism might be significantly associated with cancer risk, while the results of some other studies were controversial. Databases with time limitation from January 1984 to April 2015 were searched. The pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval was calculated to assess the associations, and subgroup meta-analyses were performed according to the type of cancer and ethnicity of the study populations. Overall, the significant association between rs9939609 polymorphism and cancer risk was found in homozygote model and recessive model. As to subgroup classified by cancer type, there was significant association in endometrial cancer and pancreatic cancer, while no statistical significance was detected in other kind of cancers. Besides, in the subgroup analysis of ethnicity, our results indicated that rs9939609 polymorphism was significantly associated with cancer risk in Asians. The rs9939609 polymorphism may be involved the susceptibility of endometrial cancer and pancreatic cancer, especially in Asian populations. Thus, rs9939609 may be a potential biomarker in early diagnosis or gene therapy target of endometrial cancer and pancreatic cancer.

BACKGROUND: Current literature suggests that racial/ethnic minority survivors may be more likely than whites to experience economic hardship after a cancer diagnosis; however, little is known about such hardship. METHODS: Patients with lung cancer (LC) and colorectal cancer (CRC) participating in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance (CanCORS) Consortium were surveyed approximately 4 months (baseline) and 12 months (follow-up) after diagnosis. Economic hardship at follow-up was present if participants 1) indicated difficulty living on household income; and/or 2) for the following 2 months, anticipated experiencing hardships (inadequate housing, food, or medical attention) or reducing living standards to the bare necessities of life. The authors tested whether African Americans (AAs) and Hispanics were more likely than whites to experience economic hardship controlling for sex, age, education, marital status, cancer stage, treatment, and economic status at baseline (income, prescription drug coverage). RESULTS: Of 3432 survivors (39.7% with LC, 60.3% with CRC), 14% were AA, 7% were Hispanic, and 79% were white. AAs and Hispanics had lower education and income than whites. Approximately 68% of AAs, 58% of Hispanics, and 44.5% of whites reported economic hardship. In LC survivors, the Hispanic-white disparity was not significant in unadjusted or adjusted analyses, and the AA-white disparity was explained by baseline economic status. In CRC survivors, the Hispanic-white disparity was explained by baseline economic status, and the AA-white disparity was not explained by the variables that were included in the model. CONCLUSIONS: Economic hardship was evident in almost 1 in 2 cancer survivors 1 year after diagnosis, especially AAs. Research should evaluate and address risk factors and their impact on survival and survivorship outcomes.

Within the World Health Organization-International Atomic Energy Agency (WHO-IAEA) collaboration for delivery of technical assistance to its Member States, the National Cancer Control Programme/Plan (NCCP) Core Capacity Self-Assessment Tool has been used to obtain a simple and quick qualitative overview of national cancer control planning and on-going activities. The NCCP tool was applied in 50 Member States, which were classified as low- and middle-income countries in 2012. Results show that half of these countries reported having officially endorsed an NCCP and 42% were in the process of preparing or updating one. Overall, the most relevant cancer control interventions reported to be partially developed or well established in most countries were related to the cancer prevention, early detection of cervical and breast cancers, as well as diagnosis and treatment of curable cancers. Contrarily, patient's rehabilitation, psychosocial support, human papilloma virus vaccination, breast cancer screening with mammography and control of occupational carcinogens were noted as being in early development phases. The availability of crucial resources to support interventions was perceived to be the highest in upper middle-income countries. These findings highlight specific areas where WHO, IAEA and partners could strengthen collaboration with countries to leverage on-going interventions and improve availability of resources.

BACKGROUND: The objective of the current study was to characterize the prevalence of the expectation that surgical resection of lung or colorectal cancer might be curative. The authors sought to assess patient-level, tumor-level, and communication-level factors associated with the perception of cure. METHODS: Between 2003 and 2005, a total of 3954 patients who underwent cancer-directed surgery for lung (30.3%) or colorectal (69.7%) cancer were identified from a population-based and health system-based survey of participants from multiple US regions. RESULTS: Approximately 80.0% of patients with lung cancer and 89.7% of those with colorectal cancer responded that surgery would cure their cancer. Even 57.4% and 79.8% of patients with stage IV lung and colorectal cancer, respectively, believed surgery was likely to be curative. On multivariable analyses, the odds ratio (OR) of the perception of curative intent was found to be higher among patients with colorectal versus lung cancer (OR, 2.27). Patients who were female, with an advanced tumor stage, unmarried, and having a higher number of comorbidities were less likely to believe that surgery would cure their cancer; educational level, physical function, and insurance status were not found to be associated with perception of cure. Patients who reported optimal physician communication scores (reference score, 0-80; score of 80-100 [OR, 1.40] and score of 100 [OR, 1.89]) and a shared role in decision-making with their physician (OR, 1.16) or family (OR, 1.17) had a higher odds of perceiving surgery would be curative, whereas patients who reported physician-controlled (OR, 0.56) or family-controlled (OR, 0.72) decision-making were less likely to believe surgery would provide a cure. CONCLUSIONS: Greater focus on patient-physician engagement, communication, and barriers to discussing goals of care with patients who are diagnosed with cancer is needed.

BACKGROUND: The objective of cervical screening is to detect and treat precancer to prevent cervical cancer mortality and morbidity while minimizing overtreatment of benign human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and related minor abnormalities. HPV/cytology cotesting at extended 5-year intervals currently is a recommended screening strategy in the United States, but the interval extension is controversial. In the current study, the authors examined the impact of a decade of an alternative, 3-year cotesting, on rates of precancer and cancer at Kaiser Permanente Northern California. The effect on screening efficiency, defined as numbers of cotests/colposcopy visits needed to detect a precancer, also was considered. METHODS: Two cohorts were defined. The "open cohort" included all women screened at least once during the study period; > 1 million cotests were performed. In a fixed "long-term screening cohort," the authors considered the cumulative impact of repeated screening at 3-year intervals by restricting the cohort to women first cotested in 2003 through 2004 (ie, no women entering screening later were added to this group). RESULTS: Detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3/adenocarcinoma in situ (CIN3/AIS) increased in the open cohort (2004-2006: 82.0/100,000 women screened; 2007-2009: 140.6/100,000 women screened; and 2010-2012: 126.0/100,000 women screened); cancer diagnoses were unchanged. In the long-term screening cohort, the detection of CIN3/AIS increased and then decreased to the original level (2004-2006: 80.5/100,000 women screened; 2007-2009: 118.6/100,000 women screened; and 2010-2012: 84.9./100,000 women screened). The number of cancer diagnoses was found to decrease. When viewed in terms of screening efficiency, the number of colposcopies performed to detect a single case of CIN3/AIS increased in the cohort with repeat screening. CONCLUSIONS: Repeated cotesting at a 3-year interval eventually lowers population rates of precancer and cancer. However, a greater number of colposcopies are required to detect a single precancer.

BACKGROUND: Malignancies that occur in excess among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals may be caused by immunosuppression or infections. Because histologically defined cancer subtypes have not been systematically evaluated, their risk was assessed among people with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). METHODS: Analyses included 569,268 people with AIDS from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study, a linkage of 15 US population-based HIV/AIDS and cancer registries during 1980 to 2007. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were estimated to compare cancer risk in people with AIDS to the general population overall, and stratified by age, calendar period (a proxy of changing HIV therapies), and time since onset of AIDS (a proxy of immunosuppression). RESULTS: Sixteen individual cancer histologies or histology groupings manifested significantly elevated SIRs. Risks were most elevated for adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (SIR = 11.3), neoplasms of histiocytes and accessory lymphoid cells (SIR = 10.7), giant cell carcinoma (SIR = 7.51), and leukemia not otherwise specified (SIR = 6.69). SIRs ranged from 1.4 to 4.6 for spindle cell carcinoma, bronchioloalveolar adenocarcinoma, adnexal and skin appendage neoplasms, sarcoma not otherwise specified, spindle cell sarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, mesothelioma, germ cell tumors, plasma cell tumors, immunoproliferative diseases, acute lymphocytic leukemia, and myeloid leukemias. For several of these cancer subtypes, significant declines in SIRs were observed across calendar periods (consistent with decreasing risk with improved HIV therapies) or increase in SIRs with time since onset of AIDS (ie, prolonged immunosuppression). CONCLUSIONS: The elevated risk of certain cancer subtypes in people with AIDS may point to an etiologic role of immunosuppression or infection. Future studies are needed to further investigate these associations and evaluate candidate infectious agents.

To investigate the association between hysterectomy and thyroid cancer subtypes based on histopathology. They did a nationwide, population-based, cohort study from 1973 to 2009 in Sweden. All women above 18 years of age during the period between January 1, 1973 and December 31, 2009 from the Register of Population (n = 5.704,202) were identified as the study population. Individual case ascertainment of primary thyroid cancer subtypes were restricted to 1993-2009 based on histological pathologic-anatomical-diagnosis from the Cancer Register. Thyroid cancer subtypes were categorized based on histological morphology as: papillary, follicular and others (including anaplastic and medullary thyroid carcinoma). Information on benign hysterectomy derived from the Swedish Inpatient Register. Women with a hysterectomy (exposed) were compared with women not having had a hysterectomy (unexposed) using Cox's proportional hazard ratios (HRs). The adjusted HR for papillary thyroid cancer was significantly increased in exposed as compared with unexposed women (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.04-2.79). There was no significant association between hysterectomy and follicular carcinoma or other thyroid cancers. There was a clear shift in the occurrence of thyroid cancer toward a lower attained age at the time of diagnosis among the exposed but no significant difference in overall survival when comparing exposed and unexposed (HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.48-2.16) Hysterectomy was associated with an increased risk for subsequent papillary thyroid cancer and diagnosis at a younger age compared with women not having had a hysterectomy but there were no differences in survival.

Objective: To understand the distribution of cancer deaths in China in 2015 and provide reference for the prevention and control of cancer. Methods: Based on the results of Global Burden of Disease 2015, the cancer death distributions in different age groups, sex groups, provinces or by different malignant tumor in Chinese were described. Results: The age-standardized mortality rate of cancer was 159.01/100 000 in China in 2015. The mortality rate was highest in age group >/=70 years (1 102.73/100 000), and lowest in age group 5-14 years (5.40/100 000). The mortality rate in males was 2.15 times higher than that in females. The first 5 provinces with high cancer mortality rate were Anhui, Qinghai, Sichuan, Guangxi and Henan. Lung cancer, liver cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer ranked 1-5 in term of mortality rate. Conclusion: The cancer mortality differed with age, gender, area and different malignant tumors, suggesting the necessity to develop targeted prevention and control strategies.

BACKGROUND: The hypermethylated in cancer 1/sirtuin 1 (HIC1/SIRT1) axis plays an important role in regulating the nucleotide excision repair pathway, which is the main oxaliplatin-induced damage-repair system. On the basis of prior evidence that the variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) sequence located near the promoter lesion of HIC1 is associated with HIC1 gene expression, the authors tested the hypothesis that this VNTR is associated with clinical outcome in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who receive oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy. METHODS: Four independent cohorts were tested. Patients who received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy served as the training cohort (n = 218), and those who received treatment without oxaliplatin served as the control cohort (n = 215). Two cohorts of patients who received oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy were used for validation studies (n = 176 and n = 73). The VNTR sequence near HIC1 was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction analysis and gel electrophoresis and was tested for associations with the response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival. RESULTS: In the training cohort, patients who harbored at least 5 tandem repeats (TRs) in both alleles had a significantly shorter PFS compared with those who had fewer than 4 TRs in at least 1 allele (9.5 vs 11.6 months; hazard ratio, 1.93; P = .012), and these findings remained statistically significant after multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 2.00; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-3.54; P = .018). This preliminary association was confirmed in the validation cohort, and patients who had at least 5 TRs in both alleles had a worse PFS compared with the other cohort (7.9 vs 9.8 months; hazard ratio, 1.85; P = .044). CONCLUSIONS: The current findings suggest that the VNTR sequence near HIC1 could be a predictive marker for oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer.

Circular RNAs (circRNAs) constitute a class of RNAs that only recently have come into the focus of the scientific cancer community after it was revealed that they are very abundant, highly conserved across species and show tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression. This tightly regulated, dynamic circRNA expression, in line with expression of messenger RNAs, microRNAs, and long noncoding RNAs, is altered in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies and most likely contributes to tumorigenesis. In this chapter, we will review cancer-associated and cancer-specific circRNAs, some of which have oncogenic or tumor-suppressive potential. We will specifically focus on circRNAs for which the role in cancer has been studied in more detail, and we will discuss the opportunity to use circRNAs as biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in cancer.

PURPOSE: We hypothesized that elderly patients might have age-specific genetic abnormalities yet be underrepresented in currently available sequencing repositories, which could limit the effect of sequencing efforts for this population. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Leveraging The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data portal, 9 tumor types were analyzed. The frequency distribution of cancer by age was determined and compared with Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data. Using the estimated median somatic mutational frequency of each tumor type, the samples needed beyond TCGA to detect a 10% mutational frequency were calculated. Microarray data from a separate prospective cohort were obtained from primary prostatectomy samples to determine whether elderly-specific transcriptomic alterations could be identified. RESULTS: Of the 5236 TCGA samples, 73% were from patients aged <70 years. Comparing the distribution of TCGA samples by age to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data, patients <70 years were well represented across most tumor types, but patients aged 80 to 99 years were underrepresented in all cancers (median TCGA underrepresentation of 167%). All cancers (except for colorectal) contained enough samples to detect a 10% mutational frequency in patients aged <60 years. In contrast, no cancer type had enough samples for which a 10% mutational frequency could be detected in patients aged >/=80 years. To further interrogate whether elderly patients with cancer were likely to harbor age-specific molecular abnormalities, we accessed transcriptomic data from a separate, larger database of >2000 prostate cancer samples. That analysis revealed significant differences in the expression of 10 genes in patients aged >/=70 years compared with those <70 years, of which 7 are involved in androgen signaling and/or DNA repair. CONCLUSIONS: Elderly patients have been underrepresented in genomic sequencing studies. Our data suggest the presence of elderly-specific molecular alterations. Further dedicated efforts to understand the biology of cancer among the elderly will be important moving forward.

BACKGROUND: The role of conventional radiotherapy in the management of pancreatic cancer has yet to be elucidated. Over the past decade, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has emerged as a novel therapeutic option in pancreatic cancer care. This study evaluated the survival impact of SBRT on patients with unresected pancreatic cancer. METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for unresected patients who received chemotherapy for nonmetastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma between 2004 and 2012. Four treatment groups were identified: chemotherapy alone, chemotherapy combined with external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT), chemotherapy combined with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), and chemotherapy combined with SBRT. Propensity score models predicting the odds of receiving SBRT were created to control for potential selection bias, and patients were matched by propensity scores. The survival analysis was performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS: A total of 14,331 patients met the inclusion criteria. Chemotherapy alone was delivered to 5464 patients (38.1%); 6418 (44.8%), 322 (2.3%), and 2127 (14.8%) received chemotherapy along with EBRT, IMRT, and SBRT, respectively. The unadjusted median survival before matching was 9.9, 10.9, 12.0, and 13.9 months for patients treated with chemotherapy, EBRT, IMRT, and SBRT, respectively. In separate matched analyses, SBRT remained superior to chemotherapy alone (log-rank P < .0001) and EBRT (log-rank P = .0180). After matching, survival did not differ between patients receiving IMRT and patients receiving SBRT (log-rank P = .0492). CONCLUSIONS: SBRT is associated with a significantly better outcome than chemotherapy alone or in conjunction with traditional EBRT. These results support the idea that SBRT is a promising treatment approach for patients with unresected pancreatic cancer. Cancer 2017;123:4158-4167. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is prevalent in the rapidly growing Chinese American community, yet little is known about the symptom experience to guide comprehensive treatment planning. This study evaluated symptom prevalence and patient subgroups with symptom distress in a large sample of Chinese American cancer patients. METHODS: Patients were consecutively recruited from 4 oncology practices, and they completed a translated cancer symptom scale. Latent class cluster analysis was used to identify subgroups of patients with distinct symptom distress profiles. RESULTS: There were 1436 patients screened; 94.4% were non-English-speaking, and 45.1% were undergoing cancer therapy. The cancers included breast (32.6%), lung (14.8%), head and neck (12.5%), and hematologic cancer (10.1%). Overall, 1289 patients (89.8%) had 1 or more symptoms, and 1129 (78.6%) had 2 or more. The most prevalent symptoms were a lack of energy (57.0%), dry mouth (55.6%), feeling sad (49.3%), worrying (47.5%), and difficulty sleeping (46.8%). Symptoms causing "quite a bit" or "very much" distress included difficulty sleeping (37.9%), a lack of appetite (37.2%), feeling nervous (35.8%), pain (35.2%), and worrying (34.0%). Four patient subgroups were identified according to the probability of reporting moderate to high symptom distress: very low physical and psychological symptom distress (49.5%), low physical symptom distress and moderate psychological symptom distress (25.2%), moderate physical and psychological symptom distress (17.4%), and high physical and psychological symptom distress (7.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Symptom prevalence is high in community-dwelling Chinese American cancer patients, and nearly half experience severe distress (rated as "quite a bit" or "very much" distressing) from physical symptoms, psychological symptoms, or both. These data have important implications for the development of effective symptom control interventions.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of endometrial cancer among young women is increasing. Some patients with low-grade endometrial cancer receive hormone therapy (HT) before surgery to preserve fertility. It is unclear whether this adversely affects survival. METHODS: Patients with localized, low-grade endometrial cancer who were aged <45 years were selected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 1993 and 2012. Propensity score matching was used to select comparable groups receiving HT or primary surgery. Cancer-specific and overall survival were measured using Kaplan-Meier methods. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated using Cox models adjusted for age, period of diagnosis, marital status, race, tumor grade, morphology, and previous radiotherapy. RESULTS: A total of 6339 women were included in the current study cohort, 161 of whom initially received HT and 6178 of whom received primary surgery. After 15 years of follow-up, all-cause mortality did not differ between the groups (HT group: 14.1% [95% CI, 6.7%-28.4%] and propensity score-matched primary surgery group: 9.3% [95% CI, 4.1%-20.5%]). Cancer-specific mortality appeared higher in patients treated with HT compared with those treated with primary surgery (9.2% [95% CI, 3.4%-24.0%] vs 2.1% [95% CI, 1.5%-2.8%]). However, this difference was driven by 3 late deaths in the HT group. Sensitivity analyses using a broader definition of cancer-specific mortality provided no statistical evidence of a survival difference between the treatment groups. The hazard ratio for the overall risk of death was 1.45 (95% CI, 0.44-4.74). CONCLUSIONS: Based on this population-based cohort, young patients with low-grade endometrial cancer appear to have excellent survival, regardless of the primary therapy chosen (HT vs primary surgery). The current selection of patients for HT to preserve fertility, which is managed carefully by experienced clinicians, does not appear to significantly worsen clinical outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Active smoking at the time of diagnosis of a first head & neck (H&N) or lung cancer is associated with a worse cancer outcome and increased mortality. However, the compared characteristics of active vs. former smokers at cancer diagnosis are poorly known. METHODS: In 371 subjects with a first H&N or lung cancer, we assessed: 1) socio-demographic features; 2) lifelong types of smoking; 3) alcohol use disorder identification test (AUDIT); 4) cannabis abuse screening test (CAST); and 5) Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Using a multivariable regression model, we compared the profile of current smokers and past smokers. RESULTS: Current smokers more frequently exhibited H&N cancer (OR 3.91; 95% CI [2.00-6.51]; p < 0.0001) and ever smoking of hand-rolled cigarettes (OR 2.2; 95% CI [1.25-3.88]; p = 0.007). Among subjects with lung cancer (n = 177), current smoking was primarily associated with ever smoking of hand-rolled cigarettes (OR 2.88; 95% CI [1.32-6.30]; p = 0.008) and negatively associated with age (OR 0.92; 95% CI [0.89-0.96]; p < 0.001). Among subjects with H&N cancer (n = 163), current smokers exhibited a significantly greater AUDIT score (OR = 1.08; 95% CI [1.01-1.16]; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: At the time of diagnosis of the first lung or H&N cancer, current smoking is highly associated with previous type of smoking and alcohol drinking patterns.

Cancer is a major chronic disease threatening the people's health in China. We reviewed the latest advances on cancer surveillance, prevention and control in our country, which may provide important clues for future cancer control. We used data from the National Central Cancer Registry, to describe and analyze the latest cancer statistics in China. We summarized updated informations on cancer control policies, conducting network, as well as programs in the country. We provided important suggestions on the future strategies of cancer prevention and control. The overall cancer burden in China has been increasing during the past decades. In 2014, there were about 3 804 000 new cancer cases and 2 296 000 cancer deaths in China. The age-standardized cancer incidence and mortality rates were 190.63/100 000 and 106.98/100 000, respectively. China has formed a comprehensive network on cancer prevention and control. Nationwide population-based cancer surveillance has been built up. The population coverage of cancer surveillance has been expanded, and the data quality has been improved. As the aging population is increasing and unhealthy life styles persist in our country, there will be an unnegligible cancer burden in China. Based on the comprehensive rationale of cancer control and prevention, National Cancer Center of China will perform its duty for future precise cancer control and prevention, based on cancer surveillance statistics.

BACKGROUND: Although the place of death has a great influence on the quality of death and dying for cancer patients, whether the survival time differs according to the place of death is unclear. The primary aim of this study was to explore potential differences in the survival time of cancer patients dying at home or in a hospital. METHODS: This multicenter, prospective cohort study was conducted in Japan from September 2012 through April 2014 and involved 58 specialist palliative care services. RESULTS: Among the 2426 patients recruited, 2069 patients were analyzed for this study: 1582 receiving hospital-based palliative care and 487 receiving home-based palliative care. A total of 1607 patients actually died in a hospital, and 462 patients died at home. The survival of patients who died at home was significantly longer than the survival of patients who died in a hospital in the days' prognosis group (estimated median survival time, 13 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 10.3-15.7 days] vs 9 days [95% CI, 8.0-10.0 days]; P = .006) and in the weeks' prognosis group (36 days [95% CI, 29.9-42.1 days] vs 29 days [95% CI, 26.5-31.5 days]; P = .007) as defined by Prognosis in Palliative Care Study predictor model A. No significant difference was identified in the months' prognosis group. Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed that the place of death had a significant influence on the survival time in both unadjusted (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78-0.96; P < .01) and adjusted models (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.77-0.97; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with cancer patients who died in a hospital, cancer patients who died at home had similar or longer survival. Cancer 2016;122:1453-1460. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

In Japan, the social (medical) health-care system is on the way to being developed to advance personalized medicine through the implementation of cancer genomic medicine, known as "cancer clinical sequencing," which uses a next-generation sequencer. However, no Japanese guidance for cancer genomic testing exists. Gene panel testing can be carried out to help determine patient treatment, confirm diagnosis, and evaluate prognostic predictions of patients with mainly solid cancers for whom no standard treatment is available. This guidance describes how to utilize gene panel testing according to the type of cancer: childhood cancer, rare cancer, carcinoma of unknown primary, and other cancers. The level of evidence classification for unified use in Japan is also detailed. This guidance establishes the basic principles of the quality control of specimens, requirements of medical institutions, informed consent, handling of data during the postanalysis stage, and treatment options based on the evidence level. In Japan, gene panel testing for cancer treatment and diagnosis is recommended to comply with this guidance. This is a collaborative work of the Japanese Society of Medical Oncology, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology, and the Japanese Cancer Association.

Primary peritoneal carcinoma is usually advanced at diagnosis and curability is low unless the patient has a small tumor burden. Peritoneal carcinoma can occur in association with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, which is thought to account for 5-6% of all breast cancer. Mutations of two breast cancer susceptibility genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are responsible for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Women with BRCA1/2 mutations often undergo risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) to prevent both ovarian and breast cancer. However, peritoneal carcinoma has been reported to develop after RRSO in patients with BRCA1/2 mutations. We experienced a patient with peritoneal carcinoma and inguinal lymph node metastasis after surgical resection of breast cancer and subsequent RRSO. This report describes the first case of peritoneal carcinoma arising after RRSO in a Japanese patient with BRCA1 mutation, including a review of the literature on peritoneal carcinoma associated with BRCA1/2 mutation.

PURPOSE: We aimed to describe the temporal trends and district-level geographical variations in cancer incidences throughout Korea during 1999-2013. Materials and Methods: Data were obtained from the Korean National Cancer Incidence Database. We calculated the age-standardized cumulative cancerincidences according to sex and geographicalregion (metropolitan cities, provinces, and districts) for three 5-year periods (1999-2003, 2004- 2008, and 2009-2013). Each quintile interval contained the same number of regions. Disease maps were created to visualize regional differences in the cancer incidences. RESULTS: Substantial differences in cancer incidences were observed according to district and cancer type. The largest variations between geographical regions were found for thyroid cancer among both men and women. There was little variation in the incidences of stomach, colorectal, and lung cancer according to geographical region. Substantially elevated incidences of specific cancers were observed in Jeollanam-do (thyroid); Daejeon (colorectum); Jeollanam-do, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and Chungcheongbuk-do (lung); Seocho-gu, Gangnam-gu and Seongnam, Bundang-gu (breast and prostate); Chungcheong and Gyeongsang provinces (stomach); Ulleung-gun and the southern districts of Gyeongsangnam-do and Jeollanam-do (liver); and along the Nakdonggang River (gallbladder and biliary tract). CONCLUSION: Mapping regional cancer incidences in Korea allowed us to compare the results according to geographical region. Our results may facilitate the development of infrastructure for systematic cancerincidence monitoring,which could promote the planning and implementation of region-specific cancer management programs.

Cancer constitutes an enormous burden on society in more and less economically developed countries alike. The occurrence of cancer is increasing because of the growth and aging of the population, as well as an increasing prevalence of established risk factors such as smoking, overweight, physical inactivity, and changing reproductive patterns associated with urbanization and economic development. Based on GLOBOCAN estimates, about 14.1 million new cancer cases and 8.2 million deaths occurred in 2012 worldwide. Over the years, the burden has shifted to less developed countries, which currently account for about 57% of cases and 65% of cancer deaths worldwide. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among males in both more and less developed countries, and has surpassed breast cancer as the leading cause of cancer death among females in more developed countries; breast cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death among females in less developed countries. Other leading causes of cancer death in more developed countries include colorectal cancer among males and females and prostate cancer among males. In less developed countries, liver and stomach cancer among males and cervical cancer among females are also leading causes of cancer death. Although incidence rates for all cancers combined are nearly twice as high in more developed than in less developed countries in both males and females, mortality rates are only 8% to 15% higher in more developed countries. This disparity reflects regional differences in the mix of cancers, which is affected by risk factors and detection practices, and/or the availability of treatment. Risk factors associated with the leading causes of cancer death include tobacco use (lung, colorectal, stomach, and liver cancer), overweight/obesity and physical inactivity (breast and colorectal cancer), and infection (liver, stomach, and cervical cancer). A substantial portion of cancer cases and deaths could be prevented by broadly applying effective prevention measures, such as tobacco control, vaccination, and the use of early detection tests.

PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to determine cancer survival and describe the unique spectrum of cancers diagnosed among New Zealand's adolescents and young adult (AYA) population. METHODS: Registrations for 1606 15-24 year olds diagnosed with a new primary malignant tumor between 2000 and 2009 were obtained from the New Zealand Cancer Registry and classified according to AYA diagnostic group and subgroup, age, sex, and prioritized ethnicity. Age-standardized incidence rates (IRs) per million person years and 5-year relative survival ratios were calculated. RESULTS: Cancer incidence was 228.6 per million for adolescents aged 15-19 years and 325.7 per million for young adults aged 20-24 years. Overall IRs were consistent across all ethnic groups but there were unique ethnic differences by tumor group including a higher incidence of bone tumors, carcinoma of the gastrointestinal tract, and gonadal germ cell tumors among Maori, a higher incidence of leukemia among Pacific peoples, and a higher incidence of melanoma among non-Maori/non-Pacific peoples. Five-year relative survival for adolescents (75.1%) and AYA overall (80.6%) appeared poorer than had been achieved in other high-income countries. Maori (69.5%) and Pacific (71.3%) AYA had lower 5-year survival compared to non-Maori/non-Pacific peoples (84.2%). CONCLUSION: The survival disparities observed require further investigation to identify and address the causes of these inferior outcomes. The newly established AYA Cancer Network Aotearoa has been tasked with improving cancer survival and care and ensuring equality of access for New Zealand AYAs with cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To understand the disease burden caused by cancers in Jinchang cohort, and develop effective strategies for cancer prevention and control in this population. METHODS: The cancer mortality data from 2001 to 2013 and the medical records for cancer patients from 2001 to 2010 in Jinchang cohort were collected. The disease burden caused by cancer was analyzed by using mortality rate, potential years of life lost (PYLL), working PYLL (WPYLL), and direct economic burden. RESULTS: During 2001-2013, in Jinchang cohort, the five leading cancers ranked by mortality rate were lung cancer (78.06/100,000), gastric cancer (38.03/100,000), liver cancer (37.23/100,000), esophageal cancer (19.06/100,000), and colorectal cancer (9.53/100,000). The five leading cancers in terms of PYLL (person-years) and WPYLL (person-years) were lung cancer (3480.33, 1161.00), liver cancer (2809.03, 1475.00), gastric cancer (2120.54, 844.00), esophageal cancer (949.61, 315.00), and colorectal cancer (539.90, 246.00). From 2001 to 2010, the five leading cancers in term of average daily cost of hospitalization were gastric cancer (8,102.23 Yuan), esophageal cancer (7135.79 Yuan), colorectal cancer (7064.38 Yuan), breast cancer (6723.53 Yuan), and lung cancer (6309.39 Yuan). CONCLUSIONS: The cancers common causing higher disease burden in Jinchang cohort were lung cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, esophageal cancer and colorectal cancer. The lung cancer disease burden was the highest.

BACKGROUND: A high frequency of hypogonadism has been reported in male patients with advanced cancer. The current study was performed to evaluate the association between low testosterone levels, symptom burden, and survival in male patients with cancer. METHODS: Of 131 consecutive male patients with cancer, 119 (91%) had an endocrine evaluation of total (TT), free (FT), and bioavailable testosterone (BT); high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP); vitamin B12; thyroid-stimulating hormone; 25-hydroxy vitamin D; and cortisol levels when presenting with symptoms of fatigue and/or anorexia-cachexia. Symptoms were evaluated by the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale. The authors examined the correlation using the Spearman test and survival with the log-rank test and Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: The median age of the patients was 64 years; the majority of patients were white (85 patients; 71%). The median TT level was 209 ng/dL (normal: >/= 200 ng/dL), the median FT was 4.4 ng/dL (normal: >/= 9 ng/dL), and the median BT was 22.0 ng/dL (normal: >/= 61 ng/dL). Low TT, FT, and BT values were all associated with worse fatigue (P </= .04), poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (P </= .05), weight loss (P </= .01), and opioid use (P </= .005). Low TT and FT were associated with increased anxiety (P </= .04), a decreased feeling of well-being (P </= .04), and increased dyspnea (P </= .05), whereas low BT was only found to be associated with anorexia (P = .05). Decreased TT, FT, and BT values were all found to be significantly associated with elevated CRP and low albumin and hemoglobin. On multivariate analysis, decreased survival was associated with low TT (hazards ratio [HR], 1.66; P = .034), declining Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (HR, 1.55; P = .004), high CRP (HR, 3.28; P < .001), and decreased albumin (HR, 2.52; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In male patients with cancer, low testosterone levels were associated with systemic inflammation, weight loss, increased symptom burden, and decreased survival. A high frequency of hypogonadism has been reported in male patients with advanced cancer. In the current study, an increased symptom burden, systemic inflammation, weight loss, opioid use, and poor survival were found to be associated with decreased testosterone levels in male patients with cancer.

PURPOSE: US Hispanics are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer as parents than their non-Hispanic white counterparts but little is known about Hispanic parents' willingness to discuss a terminal cancer diagnosis with dependent children, potentially resulting in suboptimal child coping. Therefore, we investigated Hispanic mothers' willingness to communicate with dependent children about her actual or hypothetical advanced cancer diagnosis. METHODS: Two focus groups (n = 6 participants) and three one-on-one interviews (n = 3) were conducted in either Spanish or English among adult, Mexican-American mothers with a current cancer diagnosis of any stage residing in US-Mexico border communities. Participants reported their perceived concerns, parenting challenges, and openness to discussing an incurable cancer diagnosis with a dependent child. Audio files were transcribed into English and qualitatively coded using content analysis. RESULTS: Participants, most with breast cancer, ranged in age from 25 to 47. Five had considered the possibility of their own death from advanced cancer and three had previously discussed this with their children. While many expected their children would carry on well without them, seven expressed concern for the emotional/spiritual well-being of their children. Mothers anticipated physical and time-based parenting challenges but wanted the opportunity to focus on themselves and their children in advance of death. All but one would be willing to discuss an advance cancer diagnosis with dependent children; four expressed the value of doing so or the potential harm of abdicating this responsibility. CONCLUSIONS: If faced with an advanced cancer diagnosis, Mexican-American mothers are open to communicating with dependent children.

BACKGROUND: Childhood cancer survivors are at risk for emotional distress symptoms, but symptom comorbidity has not been previously examined. This study examined distress profiles for adult survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between 1970 and 1999. METHODS: Self-reported depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms from Brief Symptom Inventory 18 were examined in survivors (n = 16,079) and siblings (n = 3085) from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. A latent profile analysis identified clusters of survivors with individual and comorbid symptoms. Disease, treatment, and demographic predictors of distress comorbidity patterns were examined with multinomial logistic regressions. RESULTS: Four clinically relevant profiles were identified: low distress on all subscales (asymptomatic, 62%), high distress on all subscales (comorbid distress, 11%), elevated somatization (somatic symptoms, 13%), and elevated depression and anxiety (affective distress, 14%). Compared with siblings, fewer survivors were asymptomatic (62% vs 74%, P < .0001), and more had comorbid distress (11% vs 5%, P < .0001). Survivors of leukemia (odds ratio [OR], 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.61), central nervous system tumors (OR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.05-1.61), and sarcoma (OR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.01-1.57) had a greater risk of comorbid distress than survivors of solid tumors. Psychoactive medications were associated with comorbid distress (P < .0001), and this suggested that this group was refractory to traditional medical management. Comorbid distress was associated with poor perceived health (OR, 31.7; 95% CI, 23.1-43.3), headaches (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 2.8-3.7), and bodily pain (OR, 4.0; 95% CI, 3.2-5.0). CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of survivors are at risk for comorbid distress, which may require extensive treatment approaches beyond those used for individual symptoms.

Cancer mortality rates in the United States continue to decline. Reductions in tobacco use, uptake of preventive measures, adoption of early detection methods, and better treatments have resulted in improved cancer outcomes for men and women. Despite this progress, some population groups continue to experience an excessive cancer burden when compared with other population groups. One of the most prominent cancer health disparities exists in prostate cancer. Prostate cancer mortality rates are highest among men of African ancestry when compared with other men, both in the United States and globally. This disparity and other cancer health disparities are largely explained by differences in access to health care, diet, lifestyle, cultural barriers, and disparate exposures to carcinogens and pathogens. Dietary and lifestyle factors, pathogens, and ancestry-related factors can modify tumor biology and induce a more aggressive disease. There are numerous examples of how environmental exposures, like tobacco, chronic stress, or dietary factors, induce an adverse tumor biology, leading to a more aggressive disease and decreased patient survival. Because of population differences in the exposure to these risk factors, they can be the cause of cancer disparities. In this review, we will summarize recent advances in our understanding of prostate and breast cancer disparities in the United States and discuss how the analysis of tumor biology can advance health disparity research.

Oncolytic viruses selectively lyse tumor cells, disrupt immunosuppression within the tumor, and reactivate antitumor immunity, but they have yet to live up to their therapeutic potential. Immune checkpoint modulation has been efficacious in a variety of cancer with an immunogenic microenvironment, but is associated with toxicity due to nonspecific T-cell activation. Therefore, combining these two strategies would likely result in both effective and specific cancer therapy. To test the hypothesis, we first constructed oncolytic adenovirus Delta-24-RGDOX expressing the immune costimulator OX40 ligand (OX40L). Like its predecessor Delta-24-RGD, Delta-24-RGDOX induced immunogenic cell death and recruit lymphocytes to the tumor site. Compared with Delta-24-RGD, Delta-24-RGDOX exhibited superior tumor-specific activation of lymphocytes and proliferation of CD8(+) T cells specific to tumor-associated antigens, resulting in cancer-specific immunity. Delta-24-RGDOX mediated more potent antiglioma activity in immunocompetent C57BL/6 but not immunodeficient athymic mice, leading to specific immune memory against the tumor. To further overcome the immune suppression mediated by programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on cancer cells accompanied with virotherapy, intratumoral injection of Delta-24-RGDOX and an anti-PD-L1 antibody showed synergistic inhibition of gliomas and significantly increased survival in mice. Our data demonstrate that combining an oncolytic virus with tumor-targeting immune checkpoint modulators elicits potent in situ autologous cancer vaccination, resulting in an efficacious, tumor-specific, and long-lasting therapeutic effect.

BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are encouraged to obtain second opinions before starting treatment. Little is known about men with localized prostate cancer who seek second opinions, the reasons why, and the association with treatment and quality of care. METHODS: We surveyed men who were diagnosed with localized prostate cancer in the greater Philadelphia area from 2012 to 2014. Men were asked if they obtained a second opinion from a urologist, and the reasons why. We used multivariable logistic regression models to evaluate the relationship between second opinions and definitive prostate cancer treatment and perceived quality of care. RESULTS: A total of 2386 men responded to the survey (adjusted response rate, 51.1%). After applying exclusion criteria, the final analytic cohort included 2365 respondents. Of these, 40% obtained second opinions, most commonly because they wanted more information about their cancer (50.8%) and wanted to be seen by the best doctor (46.3%). Overall, obtaining second opinions was not associated with definitive treatment or perceived quality of cancer care. Men who sought second opinions because they were dissatisfied with their initial urologist were less likely to receive definitive treatment (odds ratio, 0.49; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-0.73), and men who wanted more information about treatment were less likely to report excellent quality of cancer care (odds ratio, 0.70; 95% confidence interval, 0.49-0.99) compared with men who did not receive a second opinion. CONCLUSIONS: Although a large proportion of men with localized prostate cancer obtained a second opinion, the reasons for doing so were not associated with treatment choice or perceived quality of cancer care. Future study is needed to determine when second opinions contribute to increasing the value of cancer care. Cancer 2017;123:1027-34. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Although previous studies have noted an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) among moderate to heavy alcohol consumers in comparison with nondrinkers, the relation between alcohol consumption and CRC survival remains unclear. METHODS: Cases of incident invasive CRC diagnosed between 1997 and 2007 were identified via population-based cancer registries at 4 study sites in the Colon Cancer Family Registry. Study participants completed a risk-factor questionnaire on prediagnostic behaviors, including wine, beer, and liquor consumption, at the baseline. Prospective follow-up for survival was conducted for 4966 CRC cases. Cox regression was used to compare nondrinkers with individuals who consumed, on average, 1 or more servings of alcohol per day in the years preceding their CRC diagnosis with respect to overall and disease-specific survival. Separate analyses by beverage type, stratified by patient and tumor attributes, were also performed. All models were adjusted for the age at diagnosis, sex, study site, year of diagnosis, smoking history, body mass index, and education. RESULTS: Prediagnostic beer and liquor consumption was not associated with CRC survival; however, higher levels of wine consumption were modestly associated with a better prognosis overall (CRC-specific hazard ratio [HR], 0.70, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-1.03; overall HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53-0.94). Similar patterns were noted in stratified analyses. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that prediagnostic wine consumption is modestly associated with more favorable survival after CRC.

With increasing incidence and mortality, cancer is the leading cause of death in China and is a major public health problem. Because of China's massive population (1.37 billion), previous national incidence and mortality estimates have been limited to small samples of the population using data from the 1990s or based on a specific year. With high-quality data from an additional number of population-based registries now available through the National Central Cancer Registry of China, the authors analyzed data from 72 local, population-based cancer registries (2009-2011), representing 6.5% of the population, to estimate the number of new cases and cancer deaths for 2015. Data from 22 registries were used for trend analyses (2000-2011). The results indicated that an estimated 4292,000 new cancer cases and 2814,000 cancer deaths would occur in China in 2015, with lung cancer being the most common incident cancer and the leading cause of cancer death. Stomach, esophageal, and liver cancers were also commonly diagnosed and were identified as leading causes of cancer death. Residents of rural areas had significantly higher age-standardized (Segi population) incidence and mortality rates for all cancers combined than urban residents (213.6 per 100,000 vs 191.5 per 100,000 for incidence; 149.0 per 100,000 vs 109.5 per 100,000 for mortality, respectively). For all cancers combined, the incidence rates were stable during 2000 through 2011 for males (+0.2% per year; P = .1), whereas they increased significantly (+2.2% per year; P < .05) among females. In contrast, the mortality rates since 2006 have decreased significantly for both males (-1.4% per year; P < .05) and females (-1.1% per year; P < .05). Many of the estimated cancer cases and deaths can be prevented through reducing the prevalence of risk factors, while increasing the effectiveness of clinical care delivery, particularly for those living in rural areas and in disadvantaged populations.

OBJECTIVE: To perform an expedited assessment of cancer risk associated with exposure to N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) through contaminated valsartan products. DESIGN: Nationwide cohort study. SETTING: Danish health registries on individual level prescription drug use, cancer occurrence, and hospital diagnoses. PARTICIPANTS: 5150 Danish patients with no history of cancer, aged 40 years or older, and using valsartan at 1 January 2012 or initiating use between 1 January 2012 and 30 June 2017. Participants were followed from one year after cohort entry (lag time period) until experiencing a cancer outcome, death, migration, or end of study period (30 June 2018). Each participant's exposure to NDMA (ever exposure and predefined categories of cumulative valsartan exposure) was mapped out as a time varying variable while also applying a one year lag. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Association between NDMA exposure and a primary composite endpoint comprising all cancers except non-melanoma skin cancer, estimated using Cox regression. In supplementary analyses, the risk of individual cancers was determined. RESULTS: The final cohort comprised 5150 people followed for a median of 4.6 years. In total, 3625 cohort participants contributed 7344 person years classified as unexposed to NDMA, and 3450 participants contributed 11 920 person years classified as ever exposed to NDMA. With 104 cancer outcomes among NDMA unexposed participants and 198 among exposed participants, the adjusted hazard ratio for overall cancer was 1.09 (95% confidence interval 0.85 to 1.41), with no evidence of a dose-response relation (P=0.70). For single cancer outcomes, increases in risk were observed for colorectal cancer (hazard ratio 1.46, 95% confidence interval 0.79 to 2.73) and for uterine cancer (1.81, 0.55 to 5.90), although with wide confidence intervals that included the null. CONCLUSIONS: The results do not imply a markedly increased short term overall risk of cancer in users of valsartan contaminated with NDMA. However, uncertainty persists about single cancer outcomes, and studies with longer follow-up are needed to assess long term cancer risk.

A study was conducted to investigate secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN) occurrence following radiotherapy (RT) for cancer in children and young adults, to examine the spatial distribution of SMNs in relation to the irradiated field, and to evaluate a possible role of bystander effects in SMN distribution. Forty-two SMNs were identified among 7257 subjects diagnosed with cancer while living in Yorkshire, UK. Thirty-two of these occurred in patients receiving RT. Distances between SMN locations and RT field edge were estimated along with dose at SMN site. Expected radiation-induced SMN frequency in remote tissues receiving less than 0.1 Gy was predicted using risk estimates based on atomic bombing data. After a median follow-up period of 7.58 years, patients treated with RT were at a nearly five-fold increased risk of developing a subsequent primary neoplasm than the general population in the 0-29 years age range. The most common type of secondary malignancy associated with RT was of the central nervous system (28%), followed by sarcoma (25%) and leukemia (19%). Considering only solid SMNs developing 5 years or more from treatment, the spatial distribution showed a strong pattern of proximity to the irradiated field, with 68% occurring in-field or within 8 cm of the field edge. The SMN frequency in distant tissues receiving doses of less than 0.1 Gy was low but compatible with local absorbed dose.

BACKGROUND: The highest rates of thyroid cancer are observed in Pacific Island nations as well as Australia and Asian countries bordering the Pacific. The objective of this study was to determine the risk for thyroid cancer among immigrants to Canada from Southeast and East Asia compared with immigrants from other regions and nonimmigrants. METHODS: This was a population-based, longitudinal cohort study using health care administrative data to examine all residents of Ontario without pre-existing thyroid cancer. Individuals were followed from January 1997 or 5 years after they became eligible for health care coverage in Ontario, whichever came later. Patients were followed until March 2015 for incident-differentiated thyroid cancer, and then for recurrence. RESULTS: The study followed 14,659,733 individuals for a median of 17 years. Thyroid cancer incidence was 43.8 cases per 100,000 person-years among Southeast Asian immigrants, 28.6 cases per 100,000 person-years among East Asian immigrants, 21.5 cases per 100,000 person-years among other immigrants, and 14.5 cases per 100,000 person-years among nonimmigrants. Incidence was highest among immigrants from the Philippines (52.7 cases per 100,000 person-years), South Korea (33.5 cases per 100,000 person-years), and China (30.0 cases per 100,000 person-years). Adjusted hazard ratios for thyroid cancer compared with nonimmigrants were 2.66 (95% confidence interval, 2.48-2.84) for Southeast Asian immigrants, 1.87 (95% confidence interval, 1.75-2.00) for East Asian immigrants, and 1.51 (95% confidence interval, 1.45-1.57) for other immigrants. Immigrants were more likely to have papillary histology and stage I cancer. East Asian immigrants, but not Southeast Asian immigrants, had a lower risk of recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.73 [95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.94] and 1.01 [95% confidence interval, 0.81-1.26], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Immigrants from Southeast and East Asia had markedly higher thyroid cancer incidence than nonimmigrants. At particularly elevated risk were immigrants from the Philippines, South Korea, and China. Cancer 2017;123:3320-5. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

Background and Objectives: Salivary gland neoplasms are relatively uncommon. They have a wide variety of histopathological types with diverse biological behavior. It involves all the major and minor salivary glands in the head and neck. This article focuses on the various types of major salivary gland tumors treated at a tertiary cancer center along with their surgical morbidities and outcomes. Materials and Methods: Data of all the salivary gland neoplasms operated in the head and neck services between January 2012 and December 2013 were retrieved from a prospectively collected database. The clinical, demographic data and types of surgeries along with the morbidities were collated from the database and the details regarding the follow-up were collected from the electronic medical record. Results: Out of 235. cases registered, 107. patients were treated at our institute. The parotid gland was most commonly involved; majority were malignant lesions. Sixty-two patients were treatment naive at presentation. Majority presented with advanced disease. Superficial parotidectomy was the most common surgery performed and neck dissection was done in 27. patients. Facial nerve palsy was the most common complication following surgery. (16%). Sixty patients received adjuvant treatment. All patients on follow-up were alive at their last visit, with 10. patients having recurrence. Factors influencing the disease-free survival were extracapsular spread, tumor grade, and perineural invasion. Conclusion: The postoperative morbidities and outcomes for major salivary gland neoplasms in our series were acceptable and comparable to the results available in the literature. Appropriate treatment of the salivary gland neoplasm will yield good outcomes with acceptable morbidity.

PURPOSE: Cancers of the digestive system constitute a major risk for childhood cancer survivors treated with radiotherapy once they reach adulthood. The aim of this study was to determine therapy-related risk factors for the development of a second malignancy in the digestive organs (SMDO) after a childhood cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Among 4,568 2-year survivors of a childhood solid cancer diagnosed before 17 years of age at eight French and British centers, and among 25,120 patients diagnosed as having a malignant neoplasm before the age of 20 years, whose data were extracted from the Nordic Cancer Registries, we matched 58 case patients (41 men and 17 women) of SMDO and 167 controls, in their respective cohort, for sex, age at first cancer, calendar year of occurrence of the first cancer, and duration of follow-up. The radiation dose received at the site of each second malignancy and at the corresponding site of its matched control was estimated. RESULTS: The risk of developing a SMDO was 9.7-fold higher in relation to the general populations in France and the United Kingdom. In the case-control study, a strong dose-response relationship was estimated, compared with that in survivors who had not received radiotherapy; the odds ratio was 5.2 (95% CI, 1.7-16.0) for local radiation doses between 10 and 29 Gy and 9.6 (95% CI, 2.6-35.2) for doses equal to or greater than 30 Gy. Chemotherapy was also found to increase the risk of developing SMDO. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms that childhood cancer treatments strongly increase the risk of SMDO, which occur only after a very long latency period.

BACKGROUND: There are significant disparities in cancer outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Identifying the unmet supportive care needs of Indigenous Australians with cancer is imperative to improve their cancer care. The purpose of the current study was to test the psychometric properties of a supportive cancer care needs assessment tool for Indigenous people (SCNAT-IP) with cancer. METHODS: The SCNAT-IP was administered to 248 Indigenous Australians diagnosed with a range of cancer types and stages, and who received treatment in 1 of 4 Queensland hospitals. All 39 items were assessed for ceiling and floor effects and were analyzed using exploratory factor analysis to determine construct validity. Identified factors were assessed for internal consistency and convergent validity to validated psychosocial tools. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis revealed a 4-factor structure (physical and psychological, hospital care, information and communication, and practical and cultural needs) explaining 51% of the variance. Internal consistency of the 4 subscales was good, with Cronbach alpha reliability coefficients ranging from .70 to .89. Convergent validity was supported by significant correlations between the SCNAT-IP with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (correlation coefficient [r] = 0.60; P<.001) and the Cancer Worry Chart (r = 0.58; P<.001) and a moderately strong negative correlation with the Assessment of Quality of Life questionnaire (r = -0.56; P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: These data provide initial support for the SCNAT-IP, a measure of multiple supportive care needs domains specific to Indigenous Australian patients with cancer undergoing treatment.

BACKGROUND: The main objectives of this study were to identify the number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including a patient-reported outcome (PRO) endpoint across a wide range of cancer specialties and to evaluate the completeness of PRO reporting according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) PRO extension. METHODS: RCTs with a PRO endpoint that had been performed across several cancer specialties and published between 2004 and 2013 were considered. Studies were evaluated on the basis of previously defined criteria, including the CONSORT PRO extension and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing the risk of bias of RCTs. Analyses were also conducted by the type of PRO endpoint (primary vs secondary) and by the cancer disease site. RESULTS: A total of 56,696 potentially eligible records were scrutinized, and 557 RCTs with a PRO evaluation, enrolling 254,677 patients overall, were identified. PROs were most frequently used in RCTs of breast (n = 123), lung (n = 85), and colorectal cancer (n = 66). Overall, PROs were secondary endpoints in 421 RCTs (76%). Four of 6 evaluated CONSORT PRO items were documented in less than 50% of the RCTs. The level of reporting was higher in RCTs with a PRO as a primary endpoint. The presence of a supplementary report was the only statistically significant factor associated with greater completeness of reporting for both RCTs with PROs as primary endpoints (beta = .19, P = .001) and RCTs with PROs as secondary endpoints (beta = .30, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of the CONSORT PRO extension is equally important across all cancer specialties. Its use can also contribute to revealing the robust PRO design of some studies, which might be obscured by poor outcome reporting.

Faced to an undetermined ovarian mass on ultrasound, an MRI is recommended and the ROMA score (combining CA125 and HE4) can be proposed (grade A). In case of suspected early stage ovarian or fallopian tube cancer, omentectomy (at least infracolonic), appendectomy, multiple peritoneal biopsies, peritoneal cytology (grade C) and pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy are recommended (grade B) for all histological types, except for the expansive mucinous subtype where lymphadenectomy may be omitted (grade C). Minimally invasive surgery is recommended for early stage ovarian cancer, if there is no risk of tumor rupture (grade B). Adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel is recommended for all high-grade ovarian or Fallopian tube cancers, stage FIGO I-IIA (grade A). In case of ovarian, Fallopian tube or primitive peritoneal cancer of FIGO III-IV stages, thoraco-abdomino-pelvic CT scan with injection (grade B) is recommended. Laparoscopic exploration for multiple biopsies (grade A) and to evaluate carcinomatosis score (at least using the Fagotti score) (grade C) are recommended to estimate the possibility of a complete surgery (i.e. no macroscopic residue). Complete medial laparotomy surgery is recommended for advanced cancers (grade B). It is recommended in advanced cancers to perform para-aortic and pelvic lymphadenectomy in case of clinical or radiological suspicion of metastatic lymph node (grade B). In the absence of clinical or radiological lymphadenopathy and in case of complete peritoneal surgery during an initial surgery for advanced cancer, it is possible not to perform a lymphadenectomy because it does not modify the medical treatment and the overall survival (grade B). Primary surgery is recommended when no tumor residue is possible (grade B). After a complete first surgery, it is recommended to deliver 6 cycles of intravenous (grade A) or to propose intraperitoneal (grade B) chemotherapy, to be discussed with patient, according to the benefit/risk ratio. After a complete interval surgery for a FIGO III stage, the hyperthermic intra peritoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) can be proposed in the same conditions of the OV-HIPEC trial (grade B). In case of tumor residue after surgery or FIGO stage IV, chemotherapy associated with bevacizumab is recommended (grade A).

BACKGROUND: The current randomized trial examined the effects of a Tibetan yoga program (TYP) versus a stretching program (STP) and usual care (UC) on sleep and fatigue in women with breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy. METHODS: Women with stage (American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM) I to III breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy were randomized to TYP (74 women), STP (68 women), or UC (85 women). Participants in the TYP and STP groups participated in 4 sessions during chemotherapy, followed by 3 booster sessions over the subsequent 6 months, and were encouraged to practice at home. Self-report measures of sleep disturbances (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), fatigue (Brief Fatigue Inventory), and actigraphy were collected at baseline; 1 week after treatment; and at 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: There were no group differences noted in total sleep disturbances or fatigue levels over time. However, patients in the TYP group reported fewer daily disturbances 1 week after treatment compared with those in the STP (difference, -0.43; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], -0.82 to -0.04 [P = .03]) and UC (difference, -0.41; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.05 [P = .02]) groups. Group differences at the other time points were maintained for TYP versus STP. Actigraphy data revealed greater minutes awake after sleep onset for patients in the STP group 1 week after treatment versus those in the TYP (difference, 15.36; 95% CI, 7.25-23.48 [P = .0003]) and UC (difference, 14.48; 95% CI, 7.09-21.87 [P = .0002]) groups. Patients in the TYP group who practiced at least 2 times a week during follow-up reported better Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and actigraphy outcomes at 3 months and 6 months after treatment compared with those who did not and better outcomes compared with those in the UC group. CONCLUSIONS: Participating in TYP during chemotherapy resulted in modest short-term benefits in sleep quality, with long-term benefits emerging over time for those who practiced TYP at least 2 times a week.

BACKGROUND: The results of the National Lung Screening Trial showed a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality and a 6.7% reduction in all-cause mortality when high-risk patients were screened with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) versus chest x-ray (CXR). The US Preventive Services Task Force has issued a grade B recommendation for LDCT screening, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and private insurers now cover the screening cost under certain conditions. The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge of, attitudes toward, and use of LDCT screening for lung cancer among family physicians. METHODS: A 32-item questionnaire was distributed to members of the South Carolina Academy of Family Physicians in 2015. Descriptive statistics were calculated. RESULTS: There were 101 respondents, and most had incorrect knowledge about which organizations recommended screening. Many physicians continued to recommend CXR for lung cancer screening. Most felt that LDCT screening increased the odds of detecting disease at earlier stages (98%) and that the benefits outweighed the harms (75%). Concerns included unnecessary procedures (88%), stress/anxiety (52%), and radiation exposure (50%). Most physicians discussed the risks/benefits of screening with their patients in some capacity (76%); however, more than 50% reported making 1 or no screening recommendations in the past year. CONCLUSIONS: Most family physicians report discussing LDCT with patients at high risk for lung cancer; however, referrals remain low. There are gaps in physician knowledge about screening guidelines and reimbursement, and this indicates a need for further educational outreach. The development of decision aids may facilitate shared decision-making discussions about screening, and targeted interventions may improve knowledge gaps. Cancer 2016;122:2324-2331.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer patients diagnosed with low- and intermediate-risk disease have several treatment options. Decisional regret after treatment is a concern, especially when poor oncologic outcomes or declines in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) occur. This study assessed determinants of longitudinal decisional regret in prostate cancer patients attending a multidisciplinary clinic and treated with radical prostatectomy (RP), external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), brachytherapy (BT), or active surveillance (AS). METHODS: Patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who attended a multidisciplinary clinic were enrolled into a prospective study from 2006 to 2014. The Decision Regret Scale was administered at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months posttreatment. HRQoL was also assessed at regular intervals using the Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite and 36-item RAND Medical Outcomes Study Short Form questionnaires. Adjusted probabilities of reporting regret were estimated via multivariable logistic regression fitted with generalized estimating equations. RESULTS: A total of 652 patients met the inclusion criteria (395 RP, 141 EBRT, 41 BT, 75 AS). Decisional regret was consistently low after all of these treatments. In multivariable models, only African American race (odds ratio, 1.67; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-2.47) was associated with greater regret across time. Age and control preference were marginally associated with regret. Regret scores were similar between RP patients who did and did not experience biochemical recurrence. Declines in HRQoL were weakly correlated with greater decisional regret. CONCLUSION: In the context of a multidisciplinary clinic, decisional regret did not differ significantly between treatment groups but was greater in African Americans and those reporting poorer HRQoL.

BACKGROUND: Increasing physical activity can improve cognition in healthy and cognitively impaired adults; however, the benefits for cancer survivors are unknown. The current study examined a 12-week physical activity intervention, compared with a control condition, on objective and self-reported cognition among breast cancer survivors. METHODS: Sedentary breast cancer survivors were randomized to an exercise arm (n = 43) or a control arm (n = 44). At baseline and at 12 weeks, objective cognition was measured with the National Institutes of Health Cognitive Toolbox, and self-reported cognition using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System scales. Linear mixed-effects regression models tested intervention effects for changes in cognition scores. RESULTS: On average, participants (n = 87) were aged 57 years (standard deviation, 10.4 years) and were 2.5 years (standard deviation, 1.3 years) post surgery. Scores on the Oral Symbol Digit subscale (a measure of processing speed) evidenced differential improvement in the exercise arm versus the control arm (b = 2.01; P < .05). The between-group differences in improvement on self-reported cognition were not statistically significant but were suggestive of potential group differences. Time since surgery moderated the correlation, and participants who were </=2 years post surgery had a significantly greater improvement in Oral Symbol Digit score (exercise vs control (b = 4.00; P < .01), but no significant improvement was observed in patients who were >2 years postsurgery (b = -1.19; P = .40). A significant dose response was observed with greater increased physical activity associated with objective and self-reported cognition in the exercise arm. CONCLUSIONS: The exercise intervention significantly improved processing speed, but only among those who had been diagnosed with breast cancer within the past 2 years. Slowed processing speed can have substantial implications for independent functioning, supporting the potential importance of early implementation of an exercise intervention among patients with breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Large social networks have been associated with better overall survival, though not consistently with breast cancer (BC)-specific outcomes. This study evaluated associations of postdiagnosis social networks and BC outcomes in a large cohort. METHODS: Women from the After Breast Cancer Pooling Project (n = 9267) provided data on social networks within approximately 2 years of their diagnosis. A social network index was derived from information about the presence of a spouse/partner, religious ties, community ties, friendship ties, and numbers of living first-degree relatives. Cox models were used to evaluate associations, and a meta-analysis was used to determine whether effect estimates differed by cohort. Stratification by demographic, social, tumor, and treatment factors was performed. RESULTS: There were 1448 recurrences and 1521 deaths (990 due to BC). Associations were similar in 3 of 4 cohorts. After covariate adjustments, socially isolated women (small networks) had higher risks of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.15-1.77), BC-specific mortality (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.33-2.03), and total mortality (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.43-1.99) than socially integrated women; associations were stronger in those with stage I/II cancer. In the fourth cohort, there were no significant associations with BC-specific outcomes. A lack of a spouse/partner (P = .02) and community ties (P = .04) predicted higher BC-specific mortality in older white women but not in other women. However, a lack of relatives (P = .02) and friendship ties (P = .01) predicted higher BC-specific mortality in nonwhite women only. CONCLUSIONS: In a large pooled cohort, larger social networks were associated with better BC-specific and overall survival. Clinicians should assess social network information as a marker of prognosis because critical supports may differ with sociodemographic factors. Cancer 2017;123:1228-1237.

BACKGROUND: Detection and localization of genomic alterations and breakpoints are crucial in cancer research. The purpose of this study was to investigate, in a methodological and biological perspective, different female, hormone-dependent cancers to identify common and diverse DNA aberrations, genes, and pathways. METHODS: In this work, we analyzed tissue samples from patients with breast (n = 112), ovarian (n = 74), endometrial (n = 84), or cervical (n = 76) cancer. To identify genomic aberrations, the Circular Binary Segmentation (CBS) and Piecewise Constant Fitting (PCF) algorithms were used and segmentation thresholds optimized. The Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC) algorithm was applied to the segmented data to identify significantly altered regions and the associated genes were analyzed by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) to detect over-represented pathways and functions within the identified gene sets. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Analyses of high-resolution copy number alterations in four different female cancer types are presented. For appropriately adjusted segmentation parameters the two segmentation algorithms CBS and PCF performed similarly. We identified one region at 8q24.3 with focal aberrations that was altered at significant frequency across all four cancer types. Considering both, broad regions and focal peaks, three additional regions with gains at significant frequency were revealed at 1p21.1, 8p22, and 13q21.33, respectively. Several of these events involve known cancer-related genes, like PPP2R2A, PSCA, PTP4A3, and PTK2. In the female reproductive system (ovarian, endometrial, and cervix [OEC]), we discovered three common events: copy number gains at 5p15.33 and 15q11.2, further a copy number loss at 8p21.2. Interestingly, as many as 75% of the aberrations (75% amplifications and 86% deletions) identified by GISTIC were specific for just one cancer type and represented distinct molecular pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Our results disclose that some prominent copy number changes are shared in the four examined female, hormone-dependent cancer whereas others are definitive to specific cancer types.

Most of the pooled analyses and reviews reported an association between radiotherapy for childhood cancer and an increased thyroid cancer risk. Up to now this article presents the first systematic literature review on this association combined with a critical assessment of the methodological quality of the included articles. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched for relevant articles until May 2016. We included peer-reviewed cohort and case-control studies that investigated an association between radiotherapy for childhood cancer and the occurrence of subsequent thyroid cancer. A systematic overview is presented for the included studies. We identified 17 retrospective cohort studies, and four nested case-control studies, representing 100,818 subjects. The age range at first cancer diagnosis was 0-25.2 years. Considerable variability was found regarding study sizes, study design, treatment strategies, dose information, and follow-up periods. 20 of the 21 identified studies showed increased thyroid cancer risks associated with childhood radiation exposure. The large majority showed an increased relative risk or odds ratio confirming the association between radiotherapy and thyroid cancer although the variation in results was large. Additionally to a pooled analysis that has been published recently, we systematically included 17 further studies, which allowed us to cover information from countries that were not covered by large-scale childhood cancer survivor studies. The methodological limitations of existing studies and inconsistencies in findings across studies yielded a large study heterogeneity, which made a detailed comparison of study results difficult. There is a need to strengthen standardisation for reporting.

Obesity and cancer are one of the most important health problems is Spain. Between 23 and 28% of the adult population in Spain are obese, 39% are overweight and 36% have abdominal obesity. The association between obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and sleep obstructive apnea is well known. On the contrary, the association between obesity and cancer is less known, because the recent evidence on it. Several prospective studies have shown during the last years the strong relationship between obesity and cancer of colon, breast in post-menopausal women, endometrial, kidney and pancreas as well as esophageal adenocarcinoma. Furthermore there is recent evidence showing that liver, gallbladder, thyroid and ovarian cancer as well as leukemia, multiple myeloma and Hodgkin lymphomas are probably associated with obesity, yet more studies are needed. A better knowledge of the relation between cancer and obesity will allow improving the prevention strategies against cancer, a more efficient early detection, and a more suitable treatment of obesity and overweight. Although the mechanisms of carcinogenesis of obesity are not well established, avoiding overweight and obesity are considered one of the best approaches to reduce the risk of cancer. Therefore the general population must be aware that cancer is one of the most important hazards associated with the current obesity epidemic in our society.

BACKGROUND: As an organized screening program, the national Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (BCCEDP) was launched in the early 1990s to improve breast cancer outcomes among underserved women. To analyze the impact of the BCCEDP on breast cancer outcomes in Ohio, this study compared cancer stages and mortality across BCCEDP participants, Medicaid beneficiaries, and "all others." METHODS: This study linked data across the Ohio Cancer Incidence Surveillance System, Medicaid, the BCCEDP database, death certificates, and the US Census and identified 26,426 women aged 40 to 64 years who had been diagnosed with incident invasive breast cancer during the years 2002-2008 (deaths through 2010). The study groups were as follows: BCCEDP participants (1-time or repeat users), Medicaid beneficiaries (women enrolled in Medicaid before their cancer diagnosis [Medicaid/prediagnosis] or around the time of their cancer diagnosis [Medicaid/peridiagnosis]), and all others (women identified as neither BCCEDP participants nor Medicaid beneficiaries). The outcomes included advanced-stage cancer at diagnosis and mortality. A multivariable logistic and survival analysis was conducted to examine the independent association between the BCCEDP and Medicaid status and the outcomes. RESULTS: The percentage of women presenting with advanced-stage disease was highest among women in the Medicaid/peridiagnosis group (63.4%) and lowest among BCCEDP repeat users (38.6%). With adjustments for potential confounders and even in comparison with Medicaid/prediagnosis beneficiaries, those in the Medicaid/peridiagnosis group were twice as likely to be diagnosed with advanced-stage disease (adjusted odds ratio, 2.20; 95% confidence interval, 1.83-2.66). CONCLUSIONS: Medicaid/peridiagnosis women are at particularly high risk to be diagnosed with advanced-stage disease. Efforts to reduce breast cancer disparities must target this group of women before they present to Medicaid. Cancer 2017;123:3097-106. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The treatment of patients with advanced stage laryngeal cancer includes surgery or concurrent chemoradiation (CRT). Although CRT has become more common in recent years, to the authors' knowledge, the effectiveness of complete CRT in improving survival over surgery has not been studied. METHODS: The authors examined patients in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare claims-linked data set with locoregional laryngeal cancer who were diagnosed between 1997 and 2007. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses were conducted to compare overall and cause-specific 5-year survival rates between treatment modalities, adjusting for patient sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. A propensity score-matched subcohort also was used to compare survival. RESULTS: Of the 3212 patients in the study cohort, 42% underwent surgery and 18% underwent CRT. Only approximately one-quarter of patients who were treated with CRT completed the courses. In adjusted analyses, the authors were unable to reject the null hypothesis of no difference in 5-year all-cause or cause-specific mortality risk between patients treated with surgery and patients undergoing complete CRT (hazards ratio, 1.25 [95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.71; P = .16] and hazard ratio, 1.41 [95% confidence interval, 0.9-2.2; P = .14], respectively). Older age, not currently married, Medicaid eligibility, and prior cancer history were found to be associated with a higher risk of mortality (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced laryngeal cancer who underwent complete CRT were found to have overall and cause-specific survival rates similar to those of patients undergoing surgery. However, a substantial percentage of patients who initiated CRT did not complete the course. Although CRT provides organ preservation, the benefits and trade-offs of CRT and total laryngectomy should be discussed fully with patients. The importance of completing the full course of CRT should be emphasized. Cancer 2016. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society. Cancer 2016;122:2845-2856. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) measures are commonly used in oncology research. Interest in their use for monitoring or screening is increasing. The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) is one of the most widely used HRQOL instruments. Consequently, oncology researchers and practitioners have an increasing need for reference values for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and its 7-item rapid version, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General 7 (FACT-G7), to compare FACT scores across specific subgroups of patients in research trials and practice. The objectives of this study are to provide 1) reference values from a sample of the general US adult population and a sample of adults diagnosed with cancer and 2) cutoff scores for quality of life. METHODS: A sample of the general US population (N = 1075) and a sample of patients with cancer from 12 studies (N = 5065) were analyzed. Cutoff scores were established using distribution- and anchor-based methods. Mean values for the cancer sample were analyzed by performance status, cancer type, and disease status. Also, t tests and established criteria for meaningful differences were used to compare values. RESULTS: FACT-G and FACT-G7 scores in the general US population sample and cancer sample were generally comparable. Among the sample of patients with cancer, FACT-G and FACT-G7 scores worsened with declining performance status and increasing disease status. CONCLUSIONS: These data will aid interpretation of the magnitude and meaning of FACT scores, and allow for comparisons of scores across studies.

OBJECTIVE: Cancer survivors treated with abdominal/pelvic radiation therapy (ART) have increased the risks of colorectal cancer (CRC), although evidence supporting early CRC screening for these patients is lacking. We sought to determine whether there is an elevated prevalence of adenomatous colorectal polyps in young survivors prior to the age when screening would be routinely recommended. DESIGN: We conducted a prospective study of early colonoscopic screening in cancer survivors aged 35-49 who had received ART >/=10 years previously. The planned sample size was based on prior studies reporting a prevalence of adenomatous polyps of approximately 20% among the average-risk population >/=50 years of age, in contrast to </=10% among those average-risk people aged 40-50 years, for whom screening is not routinely recommended. RESULTS: Colonoscopy was performed in 54 survivors, at a median age of 45 years (range 36-49) and after median interval from radiation treatment of 19 years (10.6-43.5). Forty-nine polyps were detected in 24 patients, with 15 patients (27.8%; 95% CI 17.6% to 40.9%) having potentially precancerous polyps. Fifty-three per cent of polyps were within or at the edge of the prior ART fields. CONCLUSIONS: Young survivors treated with ART have a polyp prevalence comparable with the average-risk population aged >/=50 years and substantially higher than previously reported for the average-risk population aged 40-50 years. These findings lend support to the early initiation of screening in these survivors. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00982059; results.

To provide an assessment of the burden of cancer in France in 2015 attributable to infectious agents. A systematic literature review in French representative cancer cases series was undertaken of the prevalence of infectious agents with the major associated cancer types. PubMed was searched for original studies published up to September 2016; random-effects meta-analyses were performed. Cancer incidence data were obtained from the French Cancer Registries Network, thereby allowing the calculation of national incidence estimates. The number of new cancer cases attributable to infectious agents was calculated using population-attributable fractions according to published methods. Of the 352,000 new cancer cases in France in 2015, 14,336 (4.1% of all new cancer cases) were attributable to infectious agents. The largest contributors were human papillomavirus (HPV) and Helicobacter pylori, responsible for 6333 and 4406 new cancer cases (1.8 and 1.3% of all new cancer cases) respectively. Infectious agents caused a non-negligible number of new cancer cases in France in 2015. Most of these cancers were preventable. The expansion of vaccination (i.e., for hepatitis B virus and HPV) and screen-and-treat programs (for HPV and hepatitis C virus, and possibly for H. pylori) could greatly reduce this cancer burden.

Second and higher-order malignancies now comprise about 18% of all incident cancers in the USA, superseding first primary cancers of the breast, lung, and prostate. The occurrence of second malignant neoplasms (SMN) is influenced by a myriad of factors, including the late effects of cancer therapy, shared aetiological factors with the primary cancer (such as tobacco use, excessive alcohol intake, and obesity), genetic predisposition, environmental determinants, host effects, and combinations of factors, including gene-environment interactions. The influence of these factors on SMN in survivors of adult-onset cancer is reviewed here. We also discuss how modifiable behavioural and lifestyle factors may contribute to SMN, and how these factors can be managed. Cancer survivorship provides an opportune time for oncologists and other health-care providers to counsel patients with regard to health promotion, not only to reduce SMN risk, but to minimize co-morbidities. In particular, the importance of smoking cessation, weight control, physical activity, and other factors consonant with adoption of a healthy lifestyle should be consistently emphasized to cancer survivors. Clinicians can also play a critical role by endorsing genetic counselling for selected patients and making referrals to dieticians, exercise trainers, and others to assist with lifestyle change interventions.

BACKGROUND: A key focus in cancer research is the discovery of biomarkers that accurately diagnose early lesions in non-invasive tissues. Several studies have identified malignancy-associated DNA methylation changes in blood, yet no general cancer biomarker has been identified to date. Here, we explore the potential of blood DNA methylation as a biomarker of pan-cancer (cancer of multiple different origins) in 41 female cancer discordant monozygotic (MZ) twin-pairs sampled before or after diagnosis using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. RESULTS: We analysed epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles in 41 cancer discordant MZ twin-pairs with affected individuals diagnosed with tumours at different single primary sites: the breast, cervix, colon, endometrium, thyroid gland, skin (melanoma), ovary, and pancreas. No significant global differences in whole blood DNA methylation profiles were observed. Epigenome-wide analyses identified one novel pan-cancer differentially methylated position at false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of 10 % (cg02444695, P = 1.8 x 10(-7)) in an intergenic region 70 kb upstream of the SASH1 tumour suppressor gene, and three suggestive signals in COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340. Replication of the four top-ranked signals in an independent sample of nine cancer-discordant MZ twin-pairs showed a similar direction of association at COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340, and significantly greater methylation discordance at AXL compared to 480 healthy concordant MZ twin-pairs. The effects at cg02444695 (near SASH1), COL11A2, and LINC00340 were the most promising in biomarker potential because the DNA methylation differences were found to pre-exist in samples obtained prior to diagnosis and were limited to a 5-year period before diagnosis. Gene expression follow-up at the top-ranked signals in 283 healthy individuals showed correlation between blood methylation and gene expression in lymphoblastoid cell lines at PRL, and in the skin tissue at AXL. A significant enrichment of differential DNA methylation was observed in enhancer regions (P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: We identified DNA methylation signatures in blood associated with pan-cancer, at or near SASH1, COL11A2, AXL, and LINC00340. Three of these signals were present up to 5 years prior to cancer diagnosis, highlighting the potential clinical utility of whole blood DNA methylation analysis in cancer surveillance.

BACKGROUND: Cancer research is among the most active biomedical research domains for the European Union (EU). However, little quantitative empirical evidence is available to guide the decisions on the choice of disease site to study, specific research domain focus or allocation of research resources. To inform national/supranational cancer research policy, high-resolution intelligence is needed. METHODS: We performed a bibliometric analysis of European cancer research papers in the Web of Science from 2002 to 2013 to quantify research activity in each of the 28 EU Member States, along with Iceland, Norway and Switzerland (EUR31), which cancer sites/research domains they addressed, and their sources of financial support (2009-2013). FINDINGS: Cancer research papers from EUR31 correlated well with national Gross Domestic Products (r(2) = 0.94). However, certain cancer sites (lung, oesophagus and pancreas) were under-researched relative to their disease burden, whereas central nervous system and blood cancers were more generously supported than their burden would warrant. An analysis of research domains indicated a paucity of research on radiotherapy (5%), palliative care (1.2%) and quality of life (0.5%). European cancer research funding in 2012-2013 amounted to approximately euro7.6 billion and came from diverse sources, especially in western Europe/Scandinavia, where in nine countries the charitable sector outspent the government but not in Eastern Europe where charitable research funding barely exists. INTERPRETATION: Several countries need to increase their cancer research outputs substantially, and/or alter their research portfolios to better match their growing (and changing) cancer burden. More co-ordination among funding agencies is required, so that resources can be attuned to align activities to research gaps and perceived clinical needs. In Eastern Europe, the charitable funding sector needs to be developed, so that both public and patient advocacy can have an active role in research.

BACKGROUND: Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is widely used among Chinese cancer patients. However, little is known about Chinese patients' expectations and barriers toward using TCM for cancer. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey within a patient-support group, the Beijing Anti-Cancer Association. We measured the outcome, Chinese cancer survivors' expectations and barriers toward TCM utilization, using a modified version of ABCAM (Attitudes and Beliefs towards Complementary and Alternative Medicine), the ABTCM (Attitudes and Beliefs towards Traditional Chinese Medicine). We used multivariate models to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic status and clinical factors on their expectations and barriers (including treatment concerns and logistical challenges domain) toward TCM. RESULTS: Among 590 participants, most patients expected TCM to boost their immune system (96%), improve their physical health (96%), and reduce symptoms (94%). Many had logistical challenges (difficulty decocting herbs (58%) and finding a good TCM physician (55%)). A few were concerned that TCM might interfere with conventional treatments (7.6%), and that many TCM treatments are not based on scientific research (9.1%). In the multivariable regression model, age </=60 years was independently associated with higher expectation score ( P = .031). Age </=60 years (coefficient 5.0, P = .003) and localized disease (coefficient 9.5, P = .001) were both associated with higher treatment concerns. Active employment status (coefficient 9.0, P = .008) and localized disease (coefficient 7.5, P = .030) were related to more logistical challenges. CONCLUSION: Age and cancer stage were related to Chinese cancer patients' perceived expectations and barriers toward TCM use. Understanding these attitudes is important for reshaping the role that TCM plays in China's patient-centered comprehensive cancer care model.

While cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated biosynthesis of arachidonic acid (AA) epoxides promotes tumor growth by driving angiogenesis, cancer cell intrinsic functions of CYPs are less understood. CYP-derived AA epoxides, called epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs), also promote the growth of tumor epithelia. In cancer cells, CYP AA epoxygenase enzymes are associated with STAT3 and mTOR signaling, but also localize in mitochondria, where they promote the electron transport chain (ETC). Recently, the diabetes drug metformin was found to inhibit CYP AA epoxygenase activity, allowing the design of more potent biguanides to target tumor growth. Biguanide inhibition of EET synthesis suppresses STAT3 and mTOR pathways, as well as the ETC. Convergence of biguanide activity and eicosanoid biology in cancer has shown a new pathway to attack cancer metabolism and provides hope for improved treatments that target this vulnerability. Inhibition of EET-mediated cancer metabolism and angiogenesis therefore provides a dual approach for targeted cancer therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: 13-Cis retinoic acid (13-CRA) is a synthetic vitamin A derivative. High-dose 13-CRA in patients with squamous cell cancers of the head and neck (SCCHNs) reduces the incidence of second primary tumors (SPTs). The authors report long-term results from a phase 3 randomized trial that compared treatment with low-dose 13-CRA versus placebo for patients who had early stage SCCHN, with a focus on the development of SPTs and overall survival (OS). METHODS: In total, 176 patients who received treatment for stage I/II SCCHN were randomized to receive either low-dose 13-CRA (weight-based dose of 7.5 mg or 10 mg) or placebo for 2 years. A competing-risk approach and the log-rank test were used to compare the time to SPT and OS, respectively, between groups. RESULTS: 13-CRA neither significantly reduced the cumulative incidence of SPT (P = .61) nor improved the time to SPT (hazard ratio [HR] for 13-CRA/placebo; 0.86; P = .61). Despite limited power, there was a trend toward improved OS for the 13-CRA arm (HR, 0.75; P = .14), particularly among patients whose index tumor was surgically excised (N = 26; HR, 0.50; P = .057) and among women (N = 39; HR, 0.44; P = .065) and never/former smokers (N = 129; HR, 0.61; P = .055), with a median follow-up of 16 years. The main 13-CRA related toxicities were dry skin and cheilitis. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with low-dose 13-CRA for 2 years did not decrease the incidence of SPT; subset analysis indicates a potential survival advantage among patients who are women and never/former smokers. More targeted interventions based on clinical risk factors and molecular characterization of tumors may yield greater success in future prevention trials. Cancer 2017;123:4653-4662.

BACKGROUND: For many chemotherapy regimens dosed based on body surface area (BSA), patients experience dose reductions or delays or discontinue treatment, thereby reducing survival. Consideration of body composition may be useful in individualizing chemotherapy dosing, but to the authors' knowledge few studies to date have examined the association of body composition with chemotherapy tolerance in patients with colon cancer. METHODS: The authors identified patients with nonmetastatic colon cancer who were diagnosed from 2006 through 2011 at Kaiser Permanente and who received leucovorin calcium/calcium folinate, 5-fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) as initial adjuvant chemotherapy (533 patients). Patients' muscle mass was quantified using clinically acquired computed tomography scans. The authors quantified chemotherapy doses, treatment dates, and related toxicities using the electronic medical record. In logistic regression models adjusting for age, sex, and American Joint Committee on Cancer stage of disease, the authors examined associations of muscle tertiles with early treatment discontinuation (<6 cycles), treatment delay (>3 days off schedule for >/=3 times), and/or dose reduction (relative dose intensity </= 0.70, based on planned treatment). RESULTS: The average age of the patients at the time of diagnosis was 58.7 years; BSA was 1.9 m(2) and body mass index was 28.7 kg/m(2) . Compared with the highest sex-specific tertile of muscle mass, patients in the lowest tertile were more likely to experience toxicities and had twice the risk of adverse outcomes while receiving FOLFOX; for early discontinuation, the odds ratio (OR) was 2.34 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.04-5.24; P for trend = .03), whereas the ORs were 2.24 (95% CI, 1.37-3.66; P for trend = .002) for treatment delay and 2.28 (95% CI, 1.19-4.36; P for trend = .01) for dose reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Lower muscle mass is associated with greater toxicity and poor chemotherapy adherence among patients receiving FOLFOX. Many chemotherapy drugs are dosed based on BSA, but treatment may be better individualized if muscle mass is considered. Cancer 2017;123:4868-77. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid tumorigenesis is characterized by a progressive loss of differentiation exhibited by a range of disease variants. The Notch receptor family (1-4) regulates developmental progression in both normal and cancerous tissues. This study sought to characterize the third Notch isoform (Notch3) across the various differentiated states of thyroid cancer, and determine its clinical impact. METHODS: Notch3 expression was analyzed in a tissue microarray of normal and pathologic thyroid biopsies from 155 patients. The functional role of Notch3 was then investigated by upregulating its expression in a follicular thyroid cancer (FTC) cell line. RESULTS: Notch3 expression regressed across decreasingly differentiated, increasingly malignant thyroid specimens, correlated with clinicopathological attributes reflecting poor prognosis, and independently predicted survival following univariate and multivariate analyses. Overexpression of the active Notch3 intracellular domain (NICD3) in a gain-of-function FTC line led to functional activation of centromere-binding protein 1, while increasing thyroid-specific gene transcription. NICD3 induction also reduced tumor burden in vivo and initiated the intrinsic apoptotic cascade, alongside suppressing cyclin and B-cell lymphoma 2 family expression. CONCLUSIONS: Loss of Notch3 expression may be fundamental to the process of dedifferentiation that accompanies thyroid oncogenesis. Conversely, activation of Notch3 in thyroid cancer exerts an antiproliferative effect and restores elements of a differentiated phenotype. These findings provide preclinical rationale for evaluating Notch3 as a disease prognosticator and therapeutic target in advanced thyroid cancer. Cancer 2017;123:769-82.

Objectives: To compare the risk of non-skin cancer in LRRK2 mutation carriers and individuals with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (iPD), explore the age at which LRRK2 mutation carriers have cancer compared to iPD subjects, and clarify whether certain cancers are more closely associated with the LRRK2 mutation than iPD. Materials and Methods: Demographic data and cancer outcomes from 830 iPD patients and 103 LRRK2 mutation carriers (27 with PD) were retrospectively collected. Oncologic data were obtained from the Cancer Registry of Norway and included cancer type and age at cancer. All study participants were of Norwegian ethnicity. Results: LRRK2 mutation carriers have increased risk of non-skin cancer compared with iPD subjects (OR 2.09; 95% CI 1.16-3.77; p = .015). A significant association was found between the mutation and breast cancer in women (OR 4.58; 95% CI 1.45-14.51; p = .010). No other associations between harboring a LRRK2 mutation and specific cancer types were uncovered. Conclusion: LRRK2 mutation carriers have an increased risk of non-skin cancer compared with iPD subjects, which was mainly driven by the association between harboring the mutation and breast cancer in women. The increased risk is likely independent of ethnicity.

Objective:: To assess aspects related to cancer in indigenous population. Methods:: This is a retrospective study developed in a public university hospital. We included patients with 18 or more years of age, diagnosed with solid tumors, and followed between 2005 and 2015. Clinical features were assessed by descriptive statistics, and survival was evaluated by Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression. Results:: Fifty patients were included. The cancer incidence was 15.73 per 100,000. The mean age at diagnosis was 54 years and most patients were female (58%). Cancer of the cervix (28%) and prostate (16%) were the most common. The mean time between the onset of symptoms and the diagnosis was 9 months and from diagnosis to the treatment was 3.4 months. Disease diagnosed at stage IV (17%) had worse overall survival (HR: 11.4; p<0.05). The 5-year survival rate ranged from 88% for prostate cancer to 0% for lung cancer. All 5-year survival rates were lower as compared to other populations. Conclusion:: The most prevalent cancer sites were cervix and prostate. Disease stage and primary site were prognostic factors. Objetivo:: Avaliar os aspectos relacionados a cancer em populacoes indigenas. Metodos:: Estudo retrospectivo conduzido em um hospital universitario publico. Foram incluidos pacientes com 18 anos ou mais, diagnosticados com tumores solidos e acompanhados entre 2005 e 2015. Os aspectos clinicos foram avaliados por meio de estatistica descritiva, e a sobrevida foi avaliada por meio de curvas de Kaplan-Meier e regressao multivariada de Cox. Resultados:: Foram incluidos 50 pacientes. A incidencia de cancer foi 15,73 por 100 mil. A media de idade ao diagnostico foi 54 anos, e a maioria era do sexo feminino (58%). O cancer de colo uterino (28%) e o de prostata (16%) foram os mais frequentes. O tempo medio entre o inicio dos sintomas e o diagnostico foi 9 meses, e entre o diagnostico e o tratamento, de 3,4 meses. Doenca diagnosticada no estagio IV (17%) resultou em pior sobrevida global (HR: 11,4; p<0,05). A sobrevida em 5 anos variou de 88% para o cancer de prostata a 0% para pulmao. Todas as taxas de sobrevida em 5 anos foram menores em comparacao a outras populacoes. Conclusao:: Os locais mais frequentes de neoplasia foram colo de utero e prostata. O estagio da doenca e o sitio primario foram fatores prognosticos.

BACKGROUND: Solid tumors residing in tissues and organs leave footprints in circulation through circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and circulating tumor DNAs (ctDNA). Characterization of the ctDNA portraits and comparison with tumor DNA mutational portraits may reveal clinically actionable information on solid tumors that is traditionally achieved through more invasive approaches. METHODS: We isolated ctDNAs from plasma of patients of 103 lung cancer and 74 other solid tumors of different tissue origins. Deep sequencing using the Guardant360 test was performed to identify mutations in 73 clinically actionable genes, and the results were associated with clinical characteristics of the patient. The mutation profiles of 37 lung cancer cases with paired ctDNA and tumor genomic DNA sequencing were used to evaluate clonal representation of tumor in circulation. Five lung cancer cases with longitudinal ctDNA sampling were monitored for cancer progression or response to treatments. RESULTS: Mutations in TP53, EGFR, and KRAS genes are most prevalent in our cohort. Mutation rates of ctDNA are similar in early (I and II) and late stage (III and IV) cancers. Mutation in DNA repair genes BRCA1, BRCA2, and ATM are found in 18.1% (32/177) of cases. Patients with higher mutation rates had significantly higher mortality rates. Lung cancer of never smokers exhibited significantly higher ctDNA mutation rates as well as higher EGFR and ERBB2 mutations than ever smokers. Comparative analysis of ctDNA and tumor DNA mutation data from the same patients showed that key driver mutations could be detected in plasma even when they were present at a minor clonal population in the tumor. Mutations of key genes found in the tumor tissue could remain in circulation even after frontline radiotherapy and chemotherapy suggesting these mutations represented resistance mechanisms. Longitudinal sampling of five lung cancer cases showed distinct changes in ctDNA mutation portraits that are consistent with cancer progression or response to EGFR drug treatment. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ctDNA mutation rates in the key tumor-associated genes are clinical parameters relevant to smoking status and mortality. Mutations in ctDNA may serve as an early detection tool for cancer. This study quantitatively confirms the hypothesis that ctDNAs in circulation is the result of dissemination of aggressive tumor clones and survival of resistant clones. This study supports the use of ctDNA profiling as a less-invasive approach to monitor cancer progression and selection of appropriate drugs during cancer evolution.

Importance: Breast cancer survivors are at an increased risk of developing certain types of hematologic malignant neoplasm after diagnosis. Objective: To estimate the incidence of various types of hematologic malignant neoplasm in breast cancer survivors, both in absolute terms and in association with the general population. Design, Setting, and Participants: This nationwide cohort study conducted in France used data from the French National Health Data System, a database that contains all of French residents' health-related expenses. All French women aged 20 to 85 years with an incident breast cancer diagnosis between July 1, 2006, and December 31, 2015, were included (n = 439 704) and followed up until hematologic malignant neoplasm occurrence, death, loss of follow-up, or December 31, 2016, whichever came first. Comparisons were made with all French women in the general population who were registered in the French general health insurance program each year from January 1, 2007, and December 31, 2016. Data analysis was performed from January 23, 2018, to May 25, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Main outcomes were incident hematologic malignant neoplasm cases occurring at least 6 months after breast cancer diagnosis. The various types of hematologic malignant neoplasm considered were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), multiple myeloma (MM), Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HL/NHL), and acute lymphoblastic leukemia or lymphocytic lymphoma (ALL/LL). Incidence of these various types was estimated among breast cancer survivors and compared with the incidence in women in the general population. Results: The 439704 women in the study had a median (interquartile range [IQR]) age of 59 (50-69) years and were followed up for a median (IQR) duration of 5 (2.8-7.5) years. Overall, 3046 cases of hematologic malignant neoplasm occurred: 509 cases (16.7%) of AML (crude incidence rate [CIR] per 100 000 person-years, 24.5; 95% CI, 22.4-26.8), 832 cases (27.3%) of MDS (CIR, 40.1; 95% CI, 37.4-42.9), and 267 cases (8.8%) of MPN (CIR, 12.8; 95% CI, 11.4-14.5). Lymphoid neoplasm cases included 420 cases (13.8%) of MM (CIR, 20.3; 95% CI, 18.4-22.3), 912 cases (29.9%) of HL/NHL (CIR, 44.4; 95% CI, 41.1-50.0), and 106 cases (3.5%) of ALL/LL (CIR, 5.1; 95% CI, 4.2-6.2). Compared with the general population, breast cancer survivors had statistically significantly higher incidence of AML (standardized incidence rate ratio [SIRR], 2.8; 95% CI, 2.5-3.2) and MDS (SIRR, 5.0; 95% CI, 4.4-5.7) and, to a lesser extent, MM (SIRR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3-1.7]) and ALL/LL (SIRR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.3-3.0). Conclusions and Relevance: The finding that AML and MDS still occur among breast cancer survivors today, and that ALL/LL and MM may also be of concern, merits the continuous monitoring of hematologic malignant neoplasms and the thorough investigations into their underlying mechanisms.

INTRODUCTION: The French Military Health Service organizes medical survey of 340,000 military men. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the practices of solid cancer screening of general practitioners in military medical units and to compare the results with the recommendations of the French National Institute of Cancer. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, observational study among general practitioners in Army Medical Unit by sending them a self-assessment questionnaire. Physicians should report on their practices for screening cancers with official screening recommendations. Compliance rates with the recommendations were reviewed. Screening practices for other cancers (prostate cancer, melanoma, thyroid cancer, lung cancer, testicular cancer) were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 133 questionnaires were analyzed. Despite a strong involvement of army general health practitioners, guidelines adherence rates (examination frequency, ages of screening beginning and ending) were of 4% for cervical cancer, 7% for breast cancer, and 37% for colorectal cancer. Those rates are comparable to those reported with civilian general practitioners. For cancers without screening recommendation, practitioners felt highly concerned, especially for the most common cancers among the military population. One third of physicians stated that they had diagnosed a testicular cancer through routine screening. CONCLUSION: Military general health practitioners feel themselves concerned by solid cancer screening, and more particularly for cancers that are the most prevalent in young adults. However, current guidelines are neither known nor applied in routine.

PURPOSE: Cancer threatens the social well-being of patients and their informal caregivers. Social life is even more profoundly affected in advanced diseases, but research on social consequences of advanced cancer is scarce. This study aims to explore social consequences of advanced cancer as experienced by patients and their informal caregivers. METHODS: Seven focus groups and seven in-depth semi-structured interviews with patients (n = 18) suffering from advanced cancer and their informal caregivers (n = 15) were conducted. Audiotapes were transcribed verbatim and open coded using a thematic analysis approach. RESULTS: Social consequences were categorized in three themes: "social engagement," "social identity," and "social network." Regarding social engagement, patients and informal caregivers said that they strive for normality by continuing their life as prior to the diagnosis, but experienced barriers in doing so. Regarding social identity, patients and informal caregivers reported feelings of social isolation. The social network became more transparent, and the value of social relations had increased since the diagnosis. Many experienced positive and negative shifts in the quantity and quality of their social relations. CONCLUSIONS: Social consequences of advanced cancer are substantial. There appears to be a great risk of social isolation in which responses from social relations play an important role. Empowering patients and informal caregivers to discuss their experienced social consequences is beneficial. Creating awareness among healthcare professionals is essential as they provide social support and anticipate on social problems. Finally, educating social relations regarding the impact of advanced cancer and effective support methods may empower social support systems and reduce feelings of isolation.

BACKGROUND: Currently, the 5-year survival rate for rectal cancer remains at <60%. The identification of potentially modifiable prognostic factors would be of considerable public health importance. A few studies have suggested associations between smoking and survival in rectal cancer; however, the evidence is inconsistent, and most of these studies were relatively small. In a large population-based cohort study, we investigated whether smoking at diagnosis is an independent prognostic factor for cancer-specific survival in rectal cancer and whether the association varies by sex, age, or treatment. METHODS: Rectal cancers (ICD10 C19-20) diagnosed between 1994 and 2012 were abstracted from the National Cancer Registry Ireland and classified by smoking status at diagnosis. Follow-up was for 5 years or until December 31, 2012. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare cancer-specific death rates in current smokers, ex-smokers, and never smokers. Subgroup analyses by age at diagnosis, sex, and treatment were conducted. RESULTS: A total of 10,794 rectal cancers were diagnosed. At diagnosis, 25% were current smokers, 24% were ex-smokers, and 51% were never smokers. Compared with never smokers, current smokers had a significantly greater rate of death from cancer (multivariable hazard ratio [HR], 1.15; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.24), but ex-smokers did not (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.94-1.11). The association was slightly stronger in men (current versus never smokers: HR = 1.13, 95% CI, 1.02-1.24) than females (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.90-1.23), but the test for interaction was not significant (P = .75). The effect of smoking was not modified by age or receipt of tumor-directed surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Rectal cancer patients who smoke at diagnosis have a statistically significant increased cancer death rate. Elucidation of the underlying mechanisms is urgently required.

PURPOSE: The National Cancer Screening Program (NCSP) in Korea supports cancer screening for stomach, liver, colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer. This study was conducted to assess trends in participation rates among Korean men and women invited to undergo screening via the NCSP as part of an effort to guide future implementation of the program in Korea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the NCSP for 2002 to 2012 were used to calculate annual participation rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) by sex, insurance status, and age group for stomach, liver, colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening. RESULTS: In 2012, participation rates for stomach, liver, colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening were 47.3%, 25.0%, 39.5%, 51.9%, and 40.9%, respectively. The participation rates increased annually by 4.3% (95% CI, 4.0 to 4.6) for stomach cancer, 3.3% (95% CI, 2.5 to 4.1) for liver cancer, 4.1% (95% CI, 3.2 to 5.0) for colorectal cancer, 4.6% (95% CI, 4.1 to 5.0) for breast cancer, and 0.9% (95% CI, -0.7 to 2.5) for cervical cancer from 2002 to 2012. CONCLUSION: Participant rates for the NCSP for the five above-mentioned cancers increased annually from 2002 to 2012.

BACKGROUND: Brachytherapy has been shown to be an efficacious and cost-effective treatment among patients with localized prostate cancer. In this study, the authors examined trends in brachytherapy use for localized prostate cancer using a large national cancer registry. METHODS: In the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB), a total of 1,547,941 patients with localized prostate cancer were identified from 1998 through 2010. Excluding patients with lymph node-positive or metastatic disease, the authors examined primary treatment trends focusing on the use of brachytherapy over time. Patients with available data (2004-2009) were stratified by National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk criteria. Controlling for year of diagnosis and demographic, clinical, and pathologic characteristics, multivariate analyses were performed examining the association between patient characteristics and receipt of brachytherapy. RESULTS: In the study cohort, brachytherapy use reached a peak of 16.7% in 2002, and then steadily declined to a low of 8% in 2010. Of the 719,789 patients with available data for risk stratification, 41.1%, 35.3%, and 23.6%, respectively, met low, intermediate, and high National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk criteria. After adjustment, patients of increasing age and those with Medicare insurance were more likely to receive brachytherapy. In contrast, patients with intermediate-risk or high-risk disease, Medicaid insurance, increasing comorbidity count, and increasing year of diagnosis were less likely to receive brachytherapy. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with localized prostate cancer who are treated at National Cancer Data Base institutions, there has been a steady decline in brachytherapy use since 2003. For low-risk patients, the declining use of brachytherapy monotherapy compared with more costly emerging therapies has significant health policy implications.

BACKGROUND: The patterns and determinants of long-term income among young people surviving cancer, and differences compared to peers, have not yet been fully explored. The objectives of this paper are to describe long-term income among young survivors of cancer, the impact of socio-demographic, disease, and treatment factors on long-term income, and income relative to the general population. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study with comparison group from the general population, using linked population-based registries, clinical data, and tax-records. Multivariate random effects regression models were used to determine survivor income, compare long-term income between survivors and comparators, and assess income determinants. Subjects included all residents of British Columbia (BC), Canada, diagnosed with cancer before 25 years of age and surviving 5 years or more. Comparators were selected from the BC general population matched by gender and birth year. RESULTS: Young cancer survivors earned significantly less than the general population. In addition, survivors of central nervous system tumors have significantly lower incomes than lymphoma survivors. Survivors who received radiation therapy have significantly lower income. Results should be interpreted with caution as the comparator group was matched by gender and date of birth. CONCLUSIONS: Depending on original diagnosis, treatment, and other characteristics, survivors face significantly lower income than peers and may require supports to gain and retain paid employment. Lower income will affect their opportunity for independent living, and will reduce productivity in the labour force.

BACKGROUND: Randomized trials have shown that androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) improves survival for men with intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with radiotherapy (RT). The benefit of ADT to patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with modern dose-escalated RT is unknown. This study evaluated the effectiveness of ADT on survival of men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer treated with dose-escalated RT. METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort analysis of men with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer from 2004 to 2007 in the National Cancer Data Base. Favorable intermediate-risk disease was defined as 1 adverse risk factor (prostate-specific antigen level of 10-20 ng/mL or Gleason score of 7) and clinical T1/T2 prostate cancer. All patients were treated with primary dose-escalated RT (>/=75.6 Gy or RT with a brachytherapy boost). Overall survival was analyzed with propensity score adjustment and Cox multivariate modeling. RESULTS: The study included 18,598 patients. The use of ADT decreased from 43.5% in 2004 to 39.5% in 2007. The propensity score-adjusted survival analysis demonstrated similar 8-year overall survival for men treated with dose-escalated RT and ADT and men treated with RT alone (77.7% vs 78.4%). ADT was not associated with improved survival in any age or comorbidity subgroup. In a sensitivity analysis using Cox multivariate modeling, the receipt of ADT was not associated with overall survival (hazard ratio, 0.99; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-1.07; P = .768). CONCLUSIONS: Adding ADT to modern dose-escalated RT was not associated with improved survival for patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer. The applicability of the survival benefit seen in older trials to modern patients is unclear. Because of the morbidity associated with ADT, dose-escalated RT alone for patients with favorable intermediate-risk prostate cancer may be a reasonable option. Cancer 2016;122:2341-2349.

Cancer is a leading cause of disease burden in Australia, particularly fatal burden, accounting for an estimated thirty percent of deaths. Many cancers develop because of exposure to lifestyle and environmental factors that are potentially modifiable. We aimed to quantify the proportions and numbers of cancer deaths and cases in Australia in 2013 attributable to 20 modifiable factors in eight broad groupings that are established causes of cancer, namely: tobacco smoke (smoking and second-hand), dietary factors (low intake of fruit, non-starchy vegetables and dietary fibre; and high intake of red and processed meat), overweight/obesity, alcohol, physical inactivity, solar ultraviolet radiation, infections (seven agents), and reproductive factors (lack of breastfeeding, menopausal hormone therapy use, combined oral contraceptive use). We estimated population attributable fractions (PAF) using standard formulae incorporating exposure prevalence and relative risk data. Of all cancer deaths in Australia in 2013, approximately 38% overall (males 41%, females 34%) could be attributed to the factors assessed; the corresponding PAF for cancer cases was 33% (males 34%, females 32%). Tobacco smoke was the leading cause of cancer deaths and cases, with PAFs of 23 and 13%, respectively, followed by dietary factors (5% deaths/5% cases), overweight/obesity (5%/4%) and infections (5%/3%). Cancer sites with the highest numbers of potentially preventable deaths/cases were lung (n = 6,776/9,272), colorectum (n = 1,974/7,380) and cutaneous melanoma (n = 1,390/7,918). We estimate that about 16,700 cancer deaths and 41,200 cancer cases could be prevented in Australia each year if people's exposures to 20 causal factors were aligned with levels recommended to minimise cancer risk.

BACKGROUND: Many patients with incurable cancer inaccurately believe that chemotherapy may cure them. Little is known about how such beliefs affect choices for care at the end of life. This study assessed whether patients with advanced cancer who believed that chemotherapy might offer a cure were more likely to receive chemotherapy in the last month of life and less likely to enroll in hospice care before death. METHODS: This study examined patients diagnosed with stage IV lung or colorectal cancer in the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance consortium, a population- and health system-based prospective cohort study. Among 722 patients who completed a baseline survey and died during the study period, logistic regression was used to assess the association of understanding goals of chemotherapy with chemotherapy use in the last month of life and hospice enrollment before death; adjustments were made for patient and tumor characteristics. RESULTS: One-third of the patients (33%) recognized that chemotherapy was "not at all" likely to cure their cancer. After adjustments, such patients were no less likely than other patients to receive end-of-life chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 1.32; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.84-2.09), but they were more likely than other patients to enroll in hospice (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.37-2.82). CONCLUSIONS: An understanding of the purpose of chemotherapy for incurable cancer is a critical aspect of informed consent. Still, advanced cancer patients who were well informed about chemotherapy's goals received late-life chemotherapy at rates similar to those for other patients. An understanding of the incurable nature of cancer, however, is associated with increased hospice enrollment before death, and this suggests important care outcomes beyond chemotherapy use.

BACKGROUND: Lipid biomarkers, such as HDL-cholesterol concentrations, have been shown to have positive, inverse, and null associations with total, breast, and colorectal cancer risks. Studies of novel lipid biomarkers, such as apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) and apolipoprotein B-100 (apo B-100), and cancer risk have been sparse, to our knowledge. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the prospective association of total, breast, colorectal, and lung cancers and cancer mortality with circulating lipid biomarkers in 15,602 female health professionals in the Women's Health Study (aged >/=45 y, free of cardiovascular disease and cancer, and without hormone replacement therapy or lipid-lowering medications at baseline). DESIGN: Cox regression models estimated HRs of cancer endpoints (19 y median follow-up) across quartiles 1 (reference) to 4 of each lipid biomarker after adjustment for cancer risk factors. RESULTS: Confirmed cases included 2163 incident cancer cases (864 breast, 198 colorectal, and 190 lung cancers) and 647 cancer deaths. Total cancer risk was significantly lower in the highest quartile of apo A-I (adjusted HR: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.90; P-trend = 0.0008) and HDL cholesterol (HR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.75, 0.97; P-trend = 0.01). For site-specific cancers, significant associations included colorectal cancer risk with HDL cholesterol (HR: 0.63; 95% CI; 0.41, 0.98; P-trend = 0.03), triglycerides (HR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.17, 2.97; P-trend = 0.02), and apo B-100 (HR: 1.60; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.49; P-trend = 0.006) and lung cancer risk with HDL cholesterol (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.38, 0.93; P-trend = 0.01). LDL cholesterol was not significantly associated with risk of total cancer or any site-specific cancers. In time-dependent models that were adjusted for the use of a lipid-lowering medication after baseline, these associations remained. CONCLUSIONS: Lipids were associated with total, lung, and colorectal cancer risks in women. Lifestyle interventions for heart-disease prevention, which reduce apo B-100 or raise HDL cholesterol, may be associated with reduced cancer risk. The Women's Health Study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000479.

UNLABELLED: We evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetic profile, pharmacodynamic effects, and antitumor activity of abemaciclib, an orally bioavailable inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) 4 and 6, in a multicenter study including phase I dose escalation followed by tumor-specific cohorts for breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, melanoma, and colorectal cancer. A total of 225 patients were enrolled: 33 in dose escalation and 192 in tumor-specific cohorts. Dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue. The maximum tolerated dose was 200 mg every 12 hours. The most common possibly related treatment-emergent adverse events involved fatigue and the gastrointestinal, renal, or hematopoietic systems. Plasma concentrations increased with dose, and pharmacodynamic effects were observed in proliferating keratinocytes and tumors. Radiographic responses were achieved in previously treated patients with breast cancer, NSCLC, and melanoma. For hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, the overall response rate was 31%; moreover, 61% of patients achieved either response or stable disease lasting >/=6 months. SIGNIFICANCE: Abemaciclib represents the first selective inhibitor of CDK4 and CDK6 with a safety profile allowing continuous dosing to achieve sustained target inhibition. This first-in-human experience demonstrates single-agent activity for patients with advanced breast cancer, NSCLC, and other solid tumors. Cancer Discov; 6(7); 740-53.

Individuals with schizophrenia are a vulnerable population that has been relatively neglected in health disparities research. Despite having an equivalent risk of developing most cancers, patients with schizophrenia are more likely to die of cancer than the general population. Cancer care disparities are likely the result of patient-, provider-, and systems-level factors and influenced by the pervasive stigma of mental illness. Individuals with schizophrenia have higher rates of health behaviors linked with cancer mortality including cigarette smoking. They also have significant medical comorbidity, are less likely to have up-to-date cancer screening, and may present at more advanced stages of illness. Patients with schizophrenia may be less likely to receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy, have more postoperative complications, and have less access to palliative care. However, opportunities exist for the interdisciplinary team, including medical, surgical, and radiation oncologists; psychiatrists; and primary care physicians, to intervene throughout the continuum of cancer care to promote survival and quality of life. This review summarizes data on overall and cancer-specific mortality for individuals with schizophrenia and reviews specific disparities across the cancer care continuum of screening, diagnosis, treatment, and end-of-life care. Using a case, the authors illustrate clinical challenges for this population including communication, informed consent, and risk of suicide, and provide suggestions for care. Finally, recommendations for research to address the disparities in cancer care for individuals with schizophrenia are discussed. Despite significant challenges, with collaboration between oncology and mental health teams, individuals with schizophrenia can receive high-quality cancer care.

BACKGROUND: Reports are limited regarding clinical and pretreatment features that might predict a pathological complete response (pathCR) after treatment in patients with esophageal cancer (EC). This might allow patient selection for different strategies. This study examines the association of a pathCR with pretreatment variables, overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and patterns of recurrence in a large cohort from a single institution. METHODS: The baseline clinical features of 911 consecutive patients with EC who were treated with trimodality therapy from January 2000 to November 2013 were analyzed. A pathCR was defined as a surgical specimen with no residual carcinoma (primary or nodes). Logistic regressions were used to identify independent baseline features associated with a pathCR. We applied log-rank testing and Cox models to determine the association between a pathCR and the time-to-event outcomes (OS and RFS). RESULTS: Of 911 patients, 218 (23.9%) achieved a pathCR. The pathCR rate was 23.1% for adenocarcinoma and 32.2% for squamous cell carcinoma. A lower pathCR rate was observed for 1) older patients (>60 years), 2) patients with poorly differentiated tumors, 3) patients with signet ring cells (SRCs), and 4) patients with a higher T stage. Patients with a pathCR had longer OS and RFS than those without a pathCR (P = .0021 and P = .0011, respectively). Recurrences occurred more in non-pathCR patients. Distant metastases were the most common type of recurrence. PathCR patients developed brain metastases at a marginally higher rate than non-pathCR patients (P = .051). CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort study, a pathCR is confirmed to be associated with better OS and RFS. The presence of a poorly differentiated tumor or SRCs reduces the likelihood of a pathCR. Future research should focus on molecular classifiers. Cancer 2017;123:4106-4113. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Risk factors for impairment in psychosexual development and satisfaction among adult survivors of childhood cancer are poorly understood. The authors compared psychosexual outcomes between survivors and healthy controls, and tested whether at-risk survivors can be identified by 1) treatment neurotoxicity or 2) diagnosis. METHODS: A total of 144 young adult survivors of childhood cancer and 144 matched controls completed questionnaires regarding psychosexual development, sexual satisfaction, and satisfaction with relationship status. Survivors were aged 20 to 40 years and were 5 to 34 years after diagnosis. Using medical chart data, survivors were divided into non-neurotoxic (48 survivors), low-dose (36 survivors), and high-dose (58 survivors) neurotoxic treatment groups. RESULTS: Apart from having fewer lifetime sex partners, survivors did not appear to differ from controls. However, survivors of brain tumors and any survivor who received high-dose neurotoxic treatment reported the lowest rates of achieving milestones of psychosexual development, whereas sexual and relationship status satisfaction were found to be related to relationship status. Neurotoxic treatment intensity further distinguished between survivors of brain tumors with and without psychosexual impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The intensity of neurotoxic treatment may be a valuable indicator of risk for psychosexual impairment relative to diagnosis alone. Health care providers should assess romantic/sexual problems among survivors at risk and make referrals if needed. Cancer 2017;123:1869-1876. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a common complication of cancer and its treatment that can significantly impair quality of life. Although the specific mechanisms remain poorly understood, inflammation is now considered to be a distinct component of CRF in addition to effects of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and other factors. One key biological pathway that may link inflammation and CRF is indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Induced by inflammatory stimuli, IDO catabolizes tryptophan to kynurenine (KYN), which is subsequently converted into neuroactive metabolites. Here we summarize current knowledge concerning the relevance of the IDO pathway to CRF, including activation of the IDO pathway in cancer patients and, as a consequence, accumulation of neurotoxic KYN metabolites and depletion of serotonin in the brain. Because IDO inhibitors are already being evaluated as therapeutic agents in cancer, the elucidation of the relationship between IDO activation and CRF in cancer patients may lead to novel diagnostic and clinical approaches to managing CRF and its debilitating consequences.

OBJECTIVES: Assessing long-term success and efficiency is an essential part of evaluating cancer control programs. The mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) can serve as an insightful indicator of cancer management outcomes for individual nations. By calculating MIRs for the top five cancers in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, the current study attempted to characterize the outcomes of national cancer management policies according to the health system ranking of each country. METHODS: The MIRs for the five most burdensome cancers globally (lung, colorectal, prostate, stomach, and breast) were calculated for all 34 OECD countries using 2012 GLOBOCAN incidence and mortality statistics. Health system rankings reported by the World Health Organization in 2000 were updated with relevant information when possible. A linear regression model was created, using MIRs as the dependent variable and health system rankings as the independent variable. RESULTS: The linear relationships between MIRs and health system rankings for the five cancers were significant, with coefficients of determination ranging from 49 to 75% when outliers were excluded. A clear outlier, Korea reported lower-than-predicted MIRs for stomach and colorectal cancer, reflecting its strong national cancer control policies, especially cancer screening. CONCLUSIONS: The MIR was found to be a practical measure for evaluating the long-term success of cancer surveillance and the efficacy of cancer control programs, especially cancer screening. Extending the use of MIRs to evaluate other cancers may also prove useful.

Heritable predisposition is an important cause of cancer in children and adolescents. Although a large number of cancer predisposition genes and their associated syndromes and malignancies have already been described, it appears likely that there are more pediatric cancer patients in whom heritable cancer predisposition syndromes have yet to be recognized. In a consensus meeting in the beginning of 2016, we convened experts in Human Genetics and Pediatric Hematology/Oncology to review the available data, to categorize the large amount of information, and to develop recommendations regarding when a cancer predisposition syndrome should be suspected in a young oncology patient. This review summarizes the current knowledge of cancer predisposition syndromes in pediatric oncology and provides essential information on clinical situations in which a childhood cancer predisposition syndrome should be suspected.

BACKGROUND: Although laryngectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with T4 larynx cancer, many patients are unable or unwilling to undergo laryngectomy and instead pursue larynx-preservation strategies combining radiotherapy (RT) and chemotherapy. Herein, the authors analyzed the National Cancer Data Base to evaluate overall survival (OS) between patients treated with surgical and organ-preserving modalities. METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was queried for patients diagnosed from 2004 through 2012 with T4M0 laryngeal cancer who underwent either laryngectomy (surgery) with adjuvant RT (SRT), chemotherapy starting concurrently within 7 days of RT (CCRT), or multiagent induction chemotherapy starting 43 to 98 days before RT (ICRT). Multivariate analysis and propensity score matching were used to explore the association between the intervention and OS. Recursive partitioning analysis was performed to identify groups benefiting from particular modalities. RESULTS: A total of 1559 patients who underwent SRT, 1597 patients who underwent CCRT, and 386 patients who underwent ICRT were included. Adjusting for covariates, CCRT was found to be associated with inferior OS compared with SRT (hazard ratio [HR], 1.55; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.41-1.70 [P<.01]) and with ICRT (HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.07-1.45 [P<.01]). OS among the patients treated with SRT did not appear to differ significantly from that of the ICRT cohort (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.73-1.03 [P = 0.10]), a finding confirmed with propensity score matching. Recursive partitioning analysis identified no subset of patients that derived an OS benefit from either approach over the other. CONCLUSIONS: OS among patients undergoing SRT was found to be superior to that of patients treated with CCRT but did not significantly differ from that of those undergoing ICRT. Because these intriguing findings require validation, SRT should remain the standard of care for patients with this disease. However, organ preservation with ICRT may be a reasonable alternative in certain patients. Cancer 2017;123:600-608. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Patients with cancer are at increased risk of developing complications of influenza. In this study, the authors assessed the effectiveness of influenza vaccination among cancer patients. METHODS: A prospective, noninterventional cohort study was conducted during the 2010 to 2011 influenza season. The cohort included adult cancer patients with solid malignancies who were receiving chemotherapy and hematologic patients who had active disease. Patients who died between October and November 2010 (N = 43) were excluded. A comparison was made between patients who received the 2011 seasonal influenza vaccine with those who did not. The primary outcome was a composite of hospitalizations for fever or acute respiratory infections, pneumonia, and/or infection-related chemotherapy interruptions. All-cause mortality was a secondary outcome. A propensity-matched analysis was conducted based on the propensity for vaccination. RESULTS: Of 806 patients who were included, 387 (48%) were vaccinated. Factors that were associated independently with vaccination included past influenza vaccination, past pneumococcal vaccination, >6 months since cancer diagnosis, country of birth, and cancer type/status. The primary outcome occurred in 111 of 387 (28.7%) vaccinated patients versus 112 of 419 (26.7%) unvaccinated patients (P = .54). No association was observed between vaccination and the primary outcome in a propensity-matched analysis (N = 436) or during peak influenza activity. The mortality rate was 11.9% (46 of 387 patients) in vaccinated patients versus 19.1% (80 of 419 patients) in unvaccinated patients (P = .005). Vaccination retained a significant association with mortality on multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 2.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-3.79) and in a propensity-matched analysis (odds ratio, 2.39; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-4.32). CONCLUSIONS: Influenza vaccination was associated with lower mortality among cancer patients, although an association with infection-related complications could not be demonstrated. The current results support efforts to promote influenza vaccination in patients with cancer.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE Comorbidity is common among cancer patients and, with an aging population, is becoming more so. Comorbidity potentially affects the development, stage at diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of people with cancer. Despite the intimate relationship between comorbidity and cancer, there is limited consensus on how to record, interpret, or manage comorbidity in the context of cancer, with the result that patients who have comorbidity are less likely to receive treatment with curative intent. Evidence in this area is lacking because of the frequent exclusion of patients with comorbidity from randomized controlled trials. There is evidence that some patients with comorbidity have potentially curative treatment unnecessarily modified, compromising optimal care. Patients with comorbidity have poorer survival, poorer quality of life, and higher health care costs. Strategies to address these issues include improving the evidence base for patients with comorbidity, further development of clinical tools to assist decision making, improved integration and coordination of care, and skill development for clinicians.

BACKGROUND: Precise diagnosis of the tissue origin for metastatic cancer of unknown primary (CUP) is essential for deciding the treatment scheme to improve patients' prognoses, since the treatment for the metastases is the same as their primary counterparts. The purpose of this study is to identify a robust gene signature that can predict the origin for CUPs. METHODS: The within-sample relative gene expression orderings (REOs) of gene pairs within individual samples, which are insensitive to experimental batch effects and data normalizations, were exploited for identifying the prediction signature. RESULTS: Using gene expression profiles of the lung-limited metastatic colorectal cancer (LmCRC), we firstly showed that the within-sample REOs in lung metastases of colorectal cancer (CRC) samples were concordant with the REOs in primary CRC samples rather than with the REOs in primary lung cancer. Based on this phenomenon, we selected five gene pairs with consistent REOs in 498 primary CRC and reversely consistent REOs in 509 lung cancer samples, which were used as a signature for predicting primary sites of metastatic CRC based on the majority voting rule. Applying the signature to 654 primary CRC and 204 primary lung cancer samples collected from multiple datasets, the prediction accuracy reached 99.36%. This signature was also applied to 24 LmCRC samples collected from three datasets produced by different laboratories and the accuracy reached 100%, suggesting that the within-sample REOs in the primary site could reveal the original tissue of metastatic cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The result demonstrated that the signature based on within-sample REOs of five gene pairs could exactly and robustly identify the primary sites of CUPs.

Decision-analytic models are increasingly used to inform health policy decisions. These models synthesize available data on disease burden and intervention effectiveness to project estimates of the long-term consequences of care, which are often absent when clinical or policy decisions must be made. While models have been influential in informing US cancer screening guidelines under ideal conditions, incorporating detailed data on real-world screening practice has been limited given the complexity of screening processes and behaviors throughout diverse health delivery systems in the United States. We describe the synergies that exist between decision-analytic models and health care utilization data that are increasingly accessible through research networks that assemble data from the growing number of electronic medical record systems. In particular, we present opportunities to enrich cancer screening models by grounding analyses in real-world data with the goals of projecting the harms and benefits of current screening practices, evaluating the value of existing and new technologies, and identifying the weakest links in the cancer screening process where efforts for improvement may be most productively focused. We highlight the example of the National Cancer Institute-funded consortium Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR), a collaboration to harmonize and analyze screening process and outcomes data on breast, colorectal, and cervical cancers across seven research centers. The pairing of models with such data can create more robust models to not only better inform policy but also inform health care systems about best approaches to improve the provision of cancer screening in the United States.

BACKGROUND: This study investigated cost-related medication nonadherence among survivors of adolescent and young adult cancer and a comparison group in the United States. METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of the 2013 to 2015 National Health Interview Survey was performed. N=953 patients who were diagnosed with cancer between the ages of 15 and 39 years were identified, and a comparison group was created using propensity scores. Cost-related medication nonadherence was determined by individuals' report of skipping medication, taking less medication, or delaying filling medication to save money in the previous year. Covariates included demographics, insurance status, financial factors (eg, out-of-pocket health care expenditures), and health-related factors (eg, comorbidity and mental distress). Chi-square tests were used to compare nonadherence between survivors and the comparison group. Logistic regressions identified covariates associated with nonadherence. RESULTS: Survivors were more likely to report nonadherence than the comparison group (23.8% vs 14.3%; P < .001). Survivors were also more likely to report that they could not afford medication, asked their physician for lower cost medication, and used alternative therapies in the previous year to save money. Uninsured survivors were more likely to report nonadherence than those privately insured (odds ratio [OR], 3.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.67-6.09). Non-Hispanic black survivors, those who reported greater mental distress, and those with greater comorbidities reported nonadherence more often than their counterparts. Survivors reporting a usual source of care were at a lower risk of nonadherence than those without it (OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.18-0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Cost-related communication with survivors may be needed to increase medication adherence. Uninsured and sicker survivors should receive regular screening to improve adherence. Future work should evaluate adherence for specific drugs. Cancer 2017;123:2726-34. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is a newer treatment option for patients with localized prostate cancer. The rates of diffusion of this technology across the United States are unknown. The goal of the current study was to describe the use of SBRT among patients with prostate cancer based on different risk groups (low, intermediate, or high risk) and by type of facility (community cancer program, comprehensive community cancer program, or academic program) in which patients were treated. METHODS: Using the National Cancer Data Base, a national registry that contains approximately 70% of patients with cancer in the United States, the authors identified 274,466 men between the ages of 40 to 80 years who were diagnosed from 2004 to 2012 with localized prostate cancer and received radiation therapy (RT) as their initial treatment. The authors described the prevalence of SBRT use each year, and multivariable analysis was used to examine factors associated with the receipt of SBRT. RESULTS: In 2004, SBRT use was low (<1% in all patient groups), and was observed to increase steadily each year. By 2012, 8.8% of low-risk patients treated at academic centers with RT received SBRT. Uptake of SBRT was highest in patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk disease. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that year of diagnosis, type of center, risk group, and race were all significantly associated with the use of SBRT. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the current study is the first report of the adoption of SBRT for localized prostate cancer across the United States. Diffusion was noted to be slowest at community cancer programs, reflecting potential barriers of cost or expertise for this new technology. Adoption of SBRT was found to be highest among patients with low-risk or intermediate-risk disease, in accordance with the bulk of patients included in published SBRT studies.

BACKGROUND: Patients with incurable cancer face many physical and emotional stressors, yet little is known about their coping strategies or the relationship between their coping strategies, quality of life (QOL), and mood. METHODS: As part of a randomized trial of palliative care, this study assessed baseline QOL (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General), mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), and coping (Brief COPE) in patients within 8 weeks of a diagnosis of incurable lung or gastrointestinal cancer and before randomization. To examine associations between coping strategies, QOL, and mood, we used linear regression, adjusting for patients' age, sex, marital status, and cancer type. RESULTS: There were 350 participants (mean age, 64.9 years), and the majority were male (54.0%), were married (70.0%), and had lung cancer (54.6%). Most reported high utilization of emotional support coping (77.0%), whereas fewer reported high utilization of acceptance (44.8%), self-blame (37.9%), and denial (28.2%). Emotional support (QOL: beta = 2.65, P < .01; depression: beta = -0.56, P = .02) and acceptance (QOL: beta = 1.55, P < .01; depression: beta = -0.37, P = .01; anxiety: beta = -0.34, P = .02) correlated with better QOL and mood. Denial (QOL: beta = -1.97, P < .01; depression: beta = 0.36, P = .01; anxiety: beta = 0.61, P < .01) and self-blame (QOL: beta = -2.31, P < .01; depression: beta = 0.58, P < .01; anxiety: beta = 0.66, P < .01) correlated with worse QOL and mood. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with newly diagnosed, incurable cancer use a variety of coping strategies. The use of emotional support and acceptance coping strategies correlated with better QOL and mood, whereas the use of denial and self-blame negatively correlated with these outcomes. Interventions to improve patients' QOL and mood should seek to cultivate the use of adaptive coping strategies. Cancer 2016;122:2110-6. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia is prognostic of higher mortality in some cancers but has not been well studied in others. We used a longitudinal design to determine the incidence and prognostic importance of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia in patients following diagnosis with lymphoma, breast (BC), colorectal (CRC), small cell lung (SCLC), or non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Medical record and tumor registry data from two large integrated delivery networks were combined for patients diagnosed with lymphoma, BC, CRC, or lung cancers (2002-2010) who had >/=1 administration of radiation/chemotherapy within 6 months of diagnosis and no evidence of hypovolemic hyponatremia. Hyponatremia incidence was measured per 1000 person-years (PY). Cox proportional hazard models assessed the prognostic value of hyponatremia as a time-varying covariate on overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: Hyponatremia incidence (%, rate) was 76 % each, 1193 and 2311 per 1000 PY, among NSCLC and SCLC patients, respectively; 37 %, 169 in BC; 64 %, 637 in CRC, and 60 %, 395 in lymphoma. Hyponatremia was negatively associated with OS in BC (HR 3.7; P = <.01), CRC (HR 2.4; P < .01), lung cancer (HR 2.4; P < .01), and lymphoma (HR 4.5; P < .01). Hyponatremia was marginally associated with shorter PFS (HR 1.3, P = .07) across cancer types. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of hyponatremia is higher than previously reported in lung cancer, is high in lymphoma, BC, and CRC and is a negative prognostic indicator for survival. Hyponatremia incidence in malignancy may be underestimated. The effects of hyponatremia correction on survival in cancer patients require further study.

OBJECTIVES: Firefighters are potentially exposed to a wide range of known and suspected carcinogens through their work. The objectives of this study were to examine the patterns of cancer among Nordic firefighters, and to compare them with the results from previous studies. METHODS: Data for this study were drawn from a linkage between the census data for 15 million people from the five Nordic countries and their cancer registries for the period 1961-2005. SIR analyses were conducted with the cancer incidence rates for the entire national study populations used as reference rates. RESULTS: A total of 16 422 male firefighters were included in the final cohort. A moderate excess risk was seen for all cancer sites combined, (SIR=1.06, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.11). There were statistically significant excesses in the age category of 30-49 years in prostate cancer (SIR=2.59, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.52) and skin melanoma (SIR=1.62, 95% CI 1.14 to 2.23), while there was almost no excess in the older ages. By contrast, an increased risk, mainly in ages of 70 years and higher, was observed for non-melanoma skin cancer (SIR=1.40, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.76), multiple myeloma (SIR=1.69, 95% CI 1.08 to 2.51), adenocarcinoma of the lung (SIR=1.90, 95% CI 1.34 to 2.62), and mesothelioma (SIR=2.59, 95% CI 1.24 to 4.77). By contrast with earlier studies, the incidence of testicular cancer was decreased (SIR=0.51, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.98). CONCLUSIONS: Some of these associations have been observed previously, and potential exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, asbestos and shift work involving disruption of circadian rhythms may partly explain these results.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between socioeconomic status and cancer incidence in the United States has not traditionally been a focus of population-based cancer surveillance systems. METHODS: Nearly 3 million tumors diagnosed between 2005 and 2009 from 16 states plus Los Angeles were assigned into 1 of 4 groupings based on the poverty rate of the residential census tract at time of diagnosis. The sex-specific risk ratio of the highest-to-lowest poverty category was measured using Poisson regression, adjusting for age and race, for 39 cancer sites. RESULTS: For all sites combined, there was a negligible association between cancer incidence and poverty; however, 32 of 39 cancer sites showed a significant association with poverty (14 positively associated and 18 negatively associated). Nineteen of these sites had monotonic increases or decreases in risk across all 4 poverty categories. The sites most strongly associated with higher poverty were Kaposi sarcoma, larynx, cervix, penis, and liver; those most strongly associated with lower poverty were melanoma, thyroid, other nonepithelial skin, and testis. Sites associated with higher poverty had lower incidence and higher mortality than those associated with lower poverty. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate the importance and relevance of including a measure of socioeconomic status in national cancer surveillance. Cancer 2014;120:2191-2198. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Importance: Cancer treatments are associated with subsequent neoplasms in survivors of childhood cancer. It is unknown whether temporal changes in therapy are associated with changes in subsequent neoplasm risk. Objective: To quantify the association between temporal changes in treatment dosing and subsequent neoplasm risk. Design, Setting, and Participants: Retrospective, multicenter cohort study of 5-year cancer survivors diagnosed before age 21 years from pediatric tertiary hospitals in the United States and Canada between 1970-1999, with follow-up through December 2015. Exposures: Radiation and chemotherapy dose changes over time. Main Outcomes and Measures: Subsequent neoplasm 15-year cumulative incidence, cumulative burden, and standardized incidence ratios for subsequent malignancies, compared by treatment decade. Multivariable models assessed relative rates (RRs) of subsequent neoplasms by 5-year increments, adjusting for demographic and clinical characteristics. Mediation analyses assessed whether changes in rates of subsequent neoplasms over time were mediated by treatment variable modifications. Results: Among 23603 survivors of childhood cancer (mean age at diagnosis, 7.7 years; 46% female) the most common initial diagnoses were acute lymphoblastic leukemia, Hodgkin lymphoma, and astrocytoma. During a mean follow-up of 20.5 years (374638 person-years at risk), 1639 survivors experienced 3115 subsequent neoplasms, including 1026 malignancies, 233 benign meningiomas, and 1856 nonmelanoma skin cancers. The most common subsequent malignancies were breast and thyroid cancers. Proportions of individuals receiving radiation decreased (77% for 1970s vs 33% for 1990s), as did median dose (30 Gy [interquartile range, 24-44] for 1970s vs 26 Gy [interquartile range, 18-45] for 1990s). Fifteen-year cumulative incidence of subsequent malignancies decreased by decade of diagnosis (2.1% [95% CI, 1.7%-2.4%] for 1970s, 1.7% [95% CI, 1.5%-2.0%] for 1980s, 1.3% [95% CI, 1.1%-1.5%] for 1990s). Reference absolute rates per 1000 person-years were 1.12 (95% CI, 0.84-1.57) for subsequent malignancies, 0.16 (95% CI, 0.06-0.41) for meningiomas, and 1.71 (95% CI, 0.88-3.33) for nonmelanoma skin cancers for survivors with reference characteristics (no chemotherapy, splenectomy, or radiation therapy; male; attained age 28 years). Standardized incidence ratios declined for subsequent malignancies over treatment decades, with advancing attained age. Relative rates declined with each 5-year increment for subsequent malignancies (RR, 0.87 [95% CI, 0.82-0.93]; P < .001), meningiomas (RR, 0.85 [95% CI, 0.75-0.97]; P = .03), and nonmelanoma skin cancers (RR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.67-0.84]; P < .001). Radiation dose changes were associated with reduced risk for subsequent malignancies, meningiomas, and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Conclusions and Relevance: Among survivors of childhood cancer, the risk of subsequent malignancies at 15 years after initial cancer diagnosis remained increased for those diagnosed in the 1990s, although the risk was lower compared with those diagnosed in the 1970s. This lower risk was associated with reduction in therapeutic radiation dose.

Now that cancer has surpassed heart disease as the top cause of death for Hispanics in the United States, it is even more critical to focus on early detection of cancer in this population. We report the results of a theory-driven education-plus-navigation pilot intervention delivered by bilingual, bicultural community health workers (CHWs) with the goal of increasing cancer screening rates and knowledge among low-income Latinas. CHWs enrolled 691 eligible women, ages 18 to 75 years, considered rarely or never screened for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer. Eligible women were scheduled for an education session and offered health care navigation support with appointment scheduling and reminder/follow-up calls. CHWs provided education to 535 (77%) eligible women, and arranged mammograms, Pap tests, or stool blood tests for 174 (25%) participants, with another 94 (14%) placed on a waiting list at a local health center. Statistically significant positive changes on knowledge of screening guidelines for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer, and beliefs/attitudes regarding early detection were observed from pre- to posttest among eligible women who attended an educational session. Results highlight the effectiveness of CHW-directed interventions in recruiting individuals for programs, educating them, and influencing cancer knowledge and screening behavior.

Patterns of polyneoplasia development were analyzed in radically operated gastric cancer patients. The second tumors were revealed in 99 of 1255 patients (7,9%) as soon as patients with early gastric cancer manifested primary-multiple malignant tumors almost two times more (15,4%). Among second tumors there were predominantly tumors of the colon, urogenital system, head and neck and also lymphoproliferative diseases. Along with tumors prior to the diagnosis "gastric cancer" there were met mostly lymphoproliferative diseases and breast cancer; of synchronous--cancer of the colon and bladder; among exposed after treatment of gastric cancer-cancer of the colon, pancreas, and skin. Radical surgery because of the second tumor was provided to 77,6% patients, palliative surgery--to 12,6%. In the treatment of second tumors there were most commonly used surgical technique--in 40 (39%) patients, radiotherapy +/- chemotherapy--in 27 (26%), the combined method (surgery+radiotherapy/chemotherapy)--in 22 (21%). Second tumors (both synchronous and metachronous) were the main cause of death of patients. Thus, the occurrence of a second tumor in patients with gastric cancer is constantly increasing the frequency of the event, with the possibility of early detection and curative treatment of synchronous and especially metachronous tumors determine the prognosis in this group of patients. Primary tumor multiplicity is not a contraindication both to a radical, including combined, and palliative treatment of each of the tumors.

Despite intense efforts to identify cancer-initiating cells in malignant brain tumours, markers linked to the function of these cells have only very recently begun to be uncovered. The notion of cancer stem cell gained prominence, several molecules and signalling pathways becoming relevant for diagnosis and treatment. Whether a substantial fraction or only a tiny minority of cells in a tumor can initiate and perpetuate cancer, is still debated. The paradigm of cancer-initiating stem cells has initially been developed with respect to blood cancers where chronic conditions such as myeloproliferative neoplasms are due to mutations acquired in a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC), which maintains the normal hierarchy to neoplastic haematopoiesis. In contrast, acute leukaemia transformation of such blood neoplasms appears to derive not only from HSCs but also from committed progenitors that cannot differentiate. This review will focus on putative novel therapy targets represented by markers described to define cancer stem/initiating cells in malignant gliomas, which have been called 'leukaemia of the brain', given their rapid migration and evolution. Parallels are drawn with other cancers, especially haematopoietic, given the similar rampant proliferation and treatment resistance of glioblastoma multiforme and secondary acute leukaemias. Genes associated with the malignant conditions and especially expressed in glioma cancer stem cells are intensively searched. Although many such molecules might only coincidentally be expressed in cancer-initiating cells, some may function in the oncogenic process, and those would be the prime candidates for diagnostic and targeted therapy. For the latter, combination therapies are likely to be envisaged, given the robust and plastic signalling networks supporting malignant proliferation.

BACKGROUND: The overall age-standardized cancer incidence rate continues to decline whereas the number of cases diagnosed each year increases. Predicting cancer incidence can help to anticipate future resource needs, evaluate primary prevention strategies, and inform research. METHODS: Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data were used to estimate the number of cancers (all sites) resulting from changes in population risk, age, and size. The authors projected to 2020 nationwide age-standardized incidence rates and cases (including the top 23 cancers). RESULTS: Since 1975, incident cases increased among white individuals, primarily caused by an aging white population, and among black individuals, primarily caused by an increasing black population. Between 2010 and 2020, it is expected that overall incidence rates (proxy for risk) will decrease slightly among black men and stabilize in other groups. By 2020, the authors predict annual cancer cases (all races, all sites) to increase among men by 24.1% (-3.2% risk and 27.3% age/growth) to >1 million cases, and by 20.6% among women (1.2% risk and 19.4% age/growth) to >900,000 cases. The largest increases are expected for melanoma (white individuals); cancers of the prostate, kidney, liver, and urinary bladder in males; and the lung, breast, uterus, and thyroid in females. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the authors predict cancer incidence rates/risk to stabilize for the majority of the population; however, they expect the number of cancer cases to increase by >20%. A greater emphasis on primary prevention and early detection is needed to counter the effect of an aging and growing population on the burden of cancer.

BACKGROUND: Despite high-quality evidence demonstrating that screening reduces mortality from breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers, a substantial portion of the population remains inadequately screened. There is a critical need to identify interventions that increase the uptake and adoption of evidence-based screening guidelines for preventable cancers at the community practice level. Text messaging (short message service, SMS) has been effective in promoting behavioral change in various clinical settings, but the overall impact and reach of text messaging interventions on cancer screening are unknown. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to assess the effect of text messaging interventions on screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancers. METHODS: We searched multiple databases for studies published between the years 2000 and 2017, including PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library, to identify controlled trials that measured the effect of text messaging on screening for breast, cervical, colorectal, or lung cancers. Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: Our search yielded 2238 citations, of which 31 underwent full review and 9 met inclusion criteria. Five studies examined screening for breast cancer, one for cervical cancer, and three for colorectal cancer. No studies were found for lung cancer screening. Absolute screening rates for individuals who received text message interventions were 0.6% to 15.0% higher than for controls. Unadjusted relative screening rates for text message recipients were 4% to 63% higher compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: Text messaging interventions appear to moderately increase screening rates for breast and cervical cancer and may have a small effect on colorectal cancer screening. Benefit was observed in various countries, including resource-poor and non-English-speaking populations. Given the paucity of data, additional research is needed to better quantify the effectiveness of this promising intervention.

BACKGROUND: The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program collects and publishes population-based cancer incidence data from registries covering approximately 28% (seer.cancer.gov/registries/data.html) of the US population. SEER incidence rates are released annually in April from data submitted the prior November. The time needed to identify, consolidate, clean, and submit data requires the latest diagnosis year included to be 3 years before release. Approaches, opportunities, and cautions for an earlier release of data based on a February submission are described. METHODS: First, cases submitted in February for the latest diagnosis year represented 92% to 98% of those in the following November submission. A reporting delay model was used to statistically adjust counts in recent diagnosis years for cases projected in the future. February submissions required larger adjustment factors than November submissions. Second, trends were checked to assess the validity. RESULTS: Most cancer sites had similar annual percent change (APC) trends for February and November 2013. Male colon and rectum cancer and female lung and bronchus cancer showed an acceleration in declining APC trends only in February. Average annual percent change (AAPC) trends for the 2 submissions were similar for all sites. CONCLUSIONS: For the first time, preliminary 2012 incidence rates, based on February submissions, are provided. An accelerated decline starting in 2008 for male colon and rectum cancer rates and male lung cancer rates did not persist when 2012 data were added. An earlier release of SEER data is possible. Caution must be exercised when one is interpreting changing trends. Use of the more conservative AAPC is advised.

Peru, like several other South American countries, is experiencing remarkable population growth, ageing, and urbanisation, which has given rise to profound changes in its epidemiological profile. Prostate and breast cancer are the most frequent cancers in men and women, respectively, in Lima and Arequipa, the two areas with population-based cancer registries. However, infection-associated cancers (cervix and stomach) are also common, and rank highest in the national cancer mortality profile. Although a foundation of surveillance informs cancer-control initiatives in Peru, improvements in the vital statistics system, and the quality and use of incidence data for the planning and assessment of cancer prevention and control actions, are needed. Existing population-based cancer registries in Lima and Arequipa, and linkages to the established national mandatory cancer reporting system, are crucial for the collection of high-quality data on national cancer incidence. The delivery of effective cancer prevention and control measures requires sustained investment in the collection of high-quality data capable of informing policies and driving research programmes.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Previous studies have shown that rebamipide is potentially protective against gastric cancer; however, no epidemiologic studies of its chemopreventive effects in patients who have a high risk of gastric cancer have been performed. The aim of this study was to investigate whether rebamipide administration reduces the risk of gastric cancer. METHODS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using data retrospectively collected from the Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service database in Korea. Patients who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for early gastric neoplasms between 2011 and 2014 were included. RESULTS: During 73,416 person-years of follow-up, 711 patients were newly diagnosed with gastric cancer, including 377 low-dose (below median) and 334 high-dose (above median) rebamipide users (37,157.4 and 36,258.3 per 100,000 person-years, respectively; log-rank test, p = 0.052). There were significant differences in gastric cancer incidence rates according to age, sex, and initial diagnosis at the time of index ESD. After adjusting for these clinical factors, high-dose use was associated with a reduced risk of gastric cancer (hazard ratio 0.858; 95% CI 0.739-0.995, p = 0.043). CONCLUSION: High-dose rebamipide is associated with reduced gastric cancer risk in high-risk populations who undergo endoscopic resection for early gastric neoplasms.

BACKGROUND: Poor accrual to cancer clinical trials may contribute to the lower improvement in survival observed for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) (those aged 15-39 years) with cancer. This has been difficult to quantify without reliable mechanisms to link incident cases with study enrollments. Using unique resources available at their National Cancer Institute-designated comprehensive cancer center, the authors compared the percentage of AYAs, children, and older adults enrolled onto cancer clinical trials and determined predictors of enrollment. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with cancer from January 2008 through December 2012 at 1 pediatric and 2 adult University of Southern California hospitals were identified through the California Cancer Registry and individually linked to institutional trial enrollment databases. The availability of clinical trials was assessed. RESULTS: Across the center, the enrollment percentage for AYAs (6%) was equal to that of older adults (6%), but was less than that for children (22%) (P < .01). Within the children's hospital, the AYA enrollment percentage was also less than that for children (15% vs 23%, respectively; P<.01). On multivariate analysis, diagnosis and site of care were found to be predictive of AYA enrollment onto therapeutic and nontherapeutic studies. Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander individuals were more likely to enroll onto nontherapeutic studies compared with non-Hispanic whites, but no racial/ethnic difference was observed for therapeutic studies. CONCLUSIONS: In the current study, the percentages of AYAs and older adults enrolled onto therapeutic trials were low but similar. Diagnosis, site of care, and race/ethnicity appear to be predictive of enrollment. Prospective mechanisms must be instituted to capture reasons for nonenrollment of AYAs and develop corrective interventions.

BACKGROUND: Residents of geothermal areas have higher incidence of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer, and kidney cancers than others. These populations are exposed to chronic low-level ground gas emissions and various pollutants from geothermal water. The aim was to assess whether habitation in geothermal areas and utilisation of geothermal water is associated with risk of cancer according to duration of residence. METHODS: The cohort obtained from the census 1981 was followed to the end of 2013. Personal identifier was used in record linkage with nation-wide emigration, death, and cancer registries. The exposed population, defined by community codes, was located on young bedrock and had utilised geothermal water supply systems since 1972. Two reference populations were located by community codes on older bedrock or had not utilised geothermal water supply systems for as long a period as had the exposed population. Adjusted hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) non-stratified and stratified on cumulative years of residence were estimated in Cox-model. RESULTS: The HR for all cancer was 1.21 (95% CI 1.12-1.30) as compared with the first reference area. The HR for pancreatic cancer was 1.93 (1.22-3.06), breast cancer, 1.48 (1.23-1.80), prostate cancer 1.47 (1.22-1.77), kidney cancer 1.46 (1.03-2.05), lymphoid and haematopoietic tissue 1.54 (1.21-1.97), non-Hodgkin s lymphoma 2.08 (1.38-3.15) and basal cell carcinoma of the skin 1.62 (1.35-1.94). Positive dose-response relationship was observed between incidence of cancers and duration of residence, and between incidence of cancer and degree of geothermal/volcanic activity in the comparison areas. CONCLUSIONS: The higher cancer incidence in geothermal areas than in reference areas is consistent with previous findings. As the dose-response relationships were positive between incidence of cancers and duration of residence, it is now more urgent than before to investigate the chemical and physical content of the geothermal water and of the ambient air of the areas to detect recognized or new carcinogens.

BACKGROUND: Cancer presents a substantial hardship for patients and their families in multiple domains beyond health and survival. Relatively little is known about the economic impact of cancer. The authors present estimates of the aggregate effects of a cancer diagnosis on employment and income in a prospective, nationally representative sample of US adults. METHODS: The authors used data from the 1990 through 2009 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, a nationally representative, prospective, population-based observational study with high-quality individual and family-level economic information. Age-adjusted, sex-stratified, individual fixed-effects regression models were used to derive estimates of the impact of cancer on employment, hours worked, individual income, and total family income. RESULTS: Significant effects of cancer on all 4 outcomes were observed. The probability of a cancer patient being employed dropped by almost 10 percentage points, and hours worked declined by up to 200 hours in the first year after diagnosis. Annual labor-market earnings dropped almost 40% within 2 years after diagnosis and remained low, whereas total family income declined by 20%, although it recovered within 4 years after the diagnosis. These economic impacts on survivors were driven by effects among men; the effects among women largely were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: A cancer diagnosis has substantial effects on the economic well-being of affected adults and their families. With the increasing number of cancer survivors in the US population, there is a growing need for examining the long-term implications for economic well-being and ways to mitigate the economic hardship associated with cancer.

The p21 Activated Kinases (PAKs) are a family of serine threonine kinases, that consist of 6 members, PAKs 1-6, which are positioned at an intersection of multiple signaling pathways implicated in oncogenesis. The PAKs were originally identified as protein kinases that function downstream of the Ras related Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac. PAK1 and PAK4, which belong to Group I and Group II PAKs, respectively, are most often associated with tumorigenesis. On account of their well characterized roles in cancer, several small molecule inhibitors are being developed to inhibit the PAKs, and there is interest in investigating their efficacy as either first line or adjuvant treatments for cancer. Studies to delineate PAK regulated signaling pathways as well as the long term effects of PAK overexpression on gene expression are beginning to shed light on the mechanism by which PAK proteins may lead to cancer when they are overexpressed or activated. This review will describe the association between PAK expression in cancer, with a focus on PAK1 and PAK4, which are most often associated with the disease. The current understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the PAKs operate in cancer will be discussed. We will also review some of the potential drug candidates, and discuss which of them are currently being tested for their efficacy in cancer treatments.

Although many efforts in cancer prevention and control have routinely focused on behavioral risk factors, such as tobacco use, or on the early detection of cancer, such as colorectal cancer screening, advances in genetic testing have created new opportunities for cancer prevention through evaluation of family history and identification of cancer-causing inherited mutations. Through the collection and evaluation of a family cancer history by a trained health care provider, patients and families at increased risk for a hereditary cancer syndrome can be identified, referred for genetic counseling and testing, and make informed decisions about options for cancer risk reduction (1). Although hereditary cancers make up a small proportion of all cancers, the number of affected persons can be large, and the level of risk among affected persons is high. Two hereditary cancer syndromes for which public health professionals have worked to reduce the burden of morbidity and mortality are hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (HBOC) and Lynch syndrome.

This study seeks to examine the extent to which cancer services are geographically located according to cancer incidence, and assess the association with cancer survival. We identified hospital sites serving English PCTs (Primary Care Trusts) with the management and treatment of breast, lung and colorectal cancer. Geographical access was estimated as travel time in minutes from LSOAs (Lower Super Output Areas) to the nearest hospital site and aggregated to PCT level. Correlations between PCT level mean travel times and cancer cases were estimated using Spearman's rank correlation. Associations between PCT level mean travel times and cancer relative survival rates were estimated using linear regression with adjustment for area deprivation and for a PCT level measure of the reported ease of obtaining a doctor's appointment. We found that cancer services tended to be located farther from areas with more cancer cases, and longer average travel times are associated with worse survival after adjustment for age, sex, year and area deprivation. This suggests that geographical access to cancer services remains a concern in England.

BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) are increasingly used in clinical settings. Prior research suggests that PROs collected at baseline may be associated with cancer survival, but most of those studies were conducted in patients with breast or lung cancer. The objective of this study was to determine the correlation between prospectively collected PROs and cancer-specific outcomes in patients with early stage colorectal cancer. METHODS: Patients who had newly diagnosed stage II or III colorectal cancer from 2009 to 2010 and had a consultation at the British Columbia Cancer Agency completed the brief Psychosocial Screen for Cancer (PSSCAN) questionnaire, which collects data on patients' perceived social supports, quality of life (QOL), anxiety and depression, and general health. PROs from the PSSCAN were linked with the Gastrointestinal Cancers Outcomes Database, which contains information on patient and tumor characteristics, treatment details, and cancer outcomes. Cox regression models were constructed for overall survival (OS), and Fine and Gray regression models were developed for disease-specific survival (DSS). RESULTS: In total, 692 patients were included. The median patient age was 67 years (range, 26-95 years), and the majority had colon cancer (61%), were diagnosed with stage III disease (54%), and received chemotherapy (58%). In general, patients felt well supported and reported good overall health and QOL. On multivariate analysis, increased fatigue was associated with worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.99; P = .00007) and DSS (HR, 1.63; P = .03), as was lack of emotional support (OS: HR, 4.36; P = .0003; DSS: HR, 1.92; P = .02). CONCLUSIONS: Although most patients described good overall health and QOL and indicated that they were generally well supported, patients who experienced more pronounced fatigue or lacked emotional support had a higher likelihood of worse OS and DSS. These findings suggest that abbreviated PROs can inform and assist clinicians to identify patients who have a worse prognosis and may need more vigilant follow-up. Cancer 2017;123:1839-1847.

Purpose Childhood cancer survivors are at increased risk of subsequent neoplasms (SNs), but the germline genetic contribution is largely unknown. We assessed the contribution of pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) mutations in cancer predisposition genes to their SN risk. Patients and Methods Whole-genome sequencing (30-fold) was performed on samples from childhood cancer survivors who were >/= 5 years since initial cancer diagnosis and participants in the St Jude Lifetime Cohort Study, a retrospective hospital-based study with prospective clinical follow-up. Germline mutations in 60 genes known to be associated with autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndromes with moderate to high penetrance were classified by their pathogenicity according to the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. Relative rates (RRs) and 95% CIs of SN occurrence by mutation status were estimated using multivariable piecewise exponential regression stratified by radiation exposure. Results Participants were 3,006 survivors (53% male; median age, 35.8 years [range, 7.1 to 69.8 years]; 56% received radiotherapy), 1,120 SNs were diagnosed among 439 survivors (14.6%), and 175 P/LP mutations were identified in 5.8% (95% CI, 5.0% to 6.7%) of survivors. Mutations were associated with significantly increased rates of breast cancer (RR, 13.9; 95% CI, 6.0 to 32.2) and sarcoma (RR, 10.6; 95% CI, 4.3 to 26.3) among irradiated survivors and with increased rates of developing any SN (RR, 4.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 9.3), breast cancer (RR, 7.7; 95% CI, 2.4 to 24.4), nonmelanoma skin cancer (RR, 11.0; 95% CI, 2.9 to 41.4), and two or more histologically distinct SNs (RR, 18.6; 95% CI, 3.5 to 99.3) among nonirradiated survivors. Conclusion The findings support referral of all survivors for genetic counseling for potential clinical genetic testing, which should be prioritized for nonirradiated survivors with any SN and for those with breast cancer or sarcoma in the field of prior irradiation.

BACKGROUND: The incidence of thyroid cancer has increased very rapidly in Korea; however, most previous studies suggested that the mortality rate for thyroid cancer remained stable. The objective of the current study was to evaluate recent changes in standardized thyroid cancer mortality using data from Statistics Korea. METHODS: Population and mortality data from 1985 through 2015 were obtained from Statistics Korea. Age-standardized mortality rates (ASMRs) from thyroid cancer per 100,000 population were calculated based on the World Health Organization standard population. RESULTS: In Korea, the ASMRs from thyroid cancer increased from 0.17 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.17-0.18) per 100,000 in 1985 to 0.85 (95% CI, 0.83-0.86) per 100,000 in 2004, which was the highest among all countries. Subsequently, the ASMRs continuously decreased to 0.42 (95% CI, 0.41-0.43) per 100,000 between 2004 and 2015. The estimated annual percent change (APC) from 1985 to 2004 was 7.94 (95% CI, 6.43-9.46), and the corresponding value from 2004 to 2015 was -4.10 (95% CI, -5.76 to -2.40). Changes in the ASMRs reflected similar patterns in men (1985-2003: APC, 8.51; 2003-2015: APC, -4.32) and women (1985-2004: APC, 7.62; 2004-2015: APC, -4.38) and were also observed in older patients (aged >/= 55 years). CONCLUSIONS: Thyroid cancer mortality in Korea increased until 2004 and then continuously decreased until 2015. Increases in the early diagnosis of thyroid cancer, changes in exposure to risk factors, and standardization in diagnosis and treatment may be associated with the decrease in thyroid cancer mortality in Korea.

BACKGROUND: Bacterial dysbiosis was previously described in human malignancies. In a recent animal model, tumour susceptibility was transmitted using faecal transplantation. Our aim was to evaluate possible association between antibiotic exposure and cancer risk. METHODS: We conducted nested case-control studies for 15 common malignancies using a large population-based electronic medical record database. Cases were defined as those with any medical code for the specific malignancy. Individuals with familial cancer syndromes were excluded. For every case, four eligible controls matched on age, sex, practice site and duration of follow-up before index-date were selected using incidence-density sampling. Exposure of interest was antibiotic therapy >1 year before index-date. Adjusted odds-ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each antibiotic type using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: 125,441 cases and 490,510 matched controls were analysed. For gastro-intestinal malignancies, the use of penicillin was associated with an elevated risk of oesophageal, gastric and pancreatic cancers. The association increased with the number of antibiotic courses and reached 1.4 for gastric cancers associated with >5 courses of penicillin (95% CI 1.2-1.8). Lung cancer risk increased with the use of penicillin, cephalosporins, or macrolides (AOR for >5 courses of penicillin: 1.4 95% CI 1.3-1.6). The risk of prostate cancer increased modestly with the use of penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides and tetracyclines. The risk of breast cancer was modestly associated with exposure to sulphonamides. There was no association between the use of anti-virals and anti-fungals and cancer risk. CONCLUSION: Recurrent exposure to certain antibiotics may be associated with cancer risk in specific organ sites.

BACKGROUND: Complete tumor resection is the most important predictor of patient survival with non-small cell lung cancer. Methods for intraoperative margin assessment after lung cancer excision are lacking. This study evaluated near-infrared (NIR) intraoperative imaging with a folate-targeted molecular contrast agent (OTL0038) for the localization of primary lung adenocarcinomas, lymph node sampling, and margin assessment. METHODS: Ten dogs with lung cancer underwent either video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or open thoracotomy and tumor excision after an intravenous injection of OTL0038. Lungs were imaged with an NIR imaging device both in vivo and ex vivo. The wound bed was re-imaged for retained fluorescence suspicious for positive tumor margins. The tumor signal-to-background ratio (SBR) was measured in all cases. Next, 3 human patients were enrolled in a proof-of-principle study. Tumor fluorescence was measured both in situ and ex vivo. RESULTS: All canine tumors fluoresced in situ (mean Fluoptics SBR, 5.2 [range, 2.7-8.1]; mean Karl Storz SBR 1.9 [range, 1.4-2.6]). In addition, the fluorescence was consistent with tumor margins on pathology. Three positive lymph nodes were discovered with NIR imaging. Also, a positive retained tumor margin was discovered upon NIR imaging of the wound bed. Human pulmonary adenocarcinomas were also fluorescent both in situ and ex vivo (mean SBR, > 2.0). CONCLUSIONS: NIR imaging can identify lung cancer in a large-animal model. In addition, NIR imaging can discriminate lymph nodes harboring cancer cells and also bring attention to a positive tumor margin. In humans, pulmonary adenocarcinomas fluoresce after the injection of the targeted contrast agent. Cancer 2017;123:1051-60. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Objective, treatment-independent markers of cancer-related fatigue are needed to advance clinical trials. In the current study, the authors evaluated physical, neurocognitive, and serologic markers for correlation with self-reported fatigue before and after (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: Women with AJCC TNM Stage I-III breast cancer consented to assessment before and after the completion of 4 cycles of dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide. Assessment included self-reported fatigue (using the Brief Fatigue Inventory), depression (using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale [CES-D]), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and 28 objective measures (grip strength in dominant and nondominant hands, 6-minute walk, daily total energy expenditure, 14 neurocognitive tests, and 10 serologic markers). Generalized linear regression models of fatigue were constructed (1 model per marker), and adjusted for depression, timing before/after chemotherapy, menopausal status, obesity, and educational level. P values were adjusted to control the False Discovery Rate. RESULTS: Of 28 subjects, 3 withdrew without completing baseline assessments. Prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy data were available for the evaluation of physical measures (25 subjects aged 50.6 +/- 9.5 years), neurocognitive tests (22 subjects), and serologic markers (10 subjects). On covariate-adjusted analysis, interleukin (IL)-12 was found to be associated with fatigue at both assessments (P<.01). Serum eotaxin (P < .01), IL-1RA (P < .01), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) (P<.01), and performance on 2 neurocognitive (Trail Making) tests (P<.01 and P = .02, respectively) were found to be inversely associated with fatigue before chemotherapy but not afterward, whereas daily energy expenditure, serum MCP-1, and serum macrophage inflammatory protein 1a (MIP-1a) were found to be associated with fatigue after receipt of chemotherapy but not before (P<.01 for each). The association between energy expenditure and fatigue was detectable only if an actively athletic subject with outlier values of energy expenditure was excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IL-12 merits confirmatory testing as an objective, treatment-independent measure of fatigue in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Cancer 2017;123:1810-1816.

BACKGROUND: Brain metastases (BM) remain an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with lung cancer. The current study evaluated population-based incidence and outcomes of BM in patients with nonmetastatic lung cancer. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with nonmetastatic first primary lung cancer between 1973 and 2011 in the Metropolitan Detroit Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry were used for the current analysis. Age-adjusted odds ratios of developing BM based on various demographic characteristics and histology were calculated with 95% confidence intervals. Adjusted Cox proportional hazard ratios and log-rank tests of Kaplan-Meier survival curves were calculated to evaluate survival differences for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). RESULTS: The incidence of BM in patients with nonmetastatic NSCLC and SCLC was 9% and 18%, respectively. There was variation in the incidence of BM according to NCSLC histology. The incidence of BM was higher in patients aged <60 years for both NSCLC and SCLC, but there were no differences noted by race for either histological group. Female patients with NSCLC were more likely to have BM than male patients. There was variation in the proportion of BM in both patients with NSCLC and SCLC over the three 13-year periods of diagnosis. The risk of death (hazard ratio) was found to be significantly higher for patients with NSCLC with BM, but was not significantly higher in patients with SCLC with BM. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of BM in patients with nonmetastatic lung cancer varies according to histology, age, and sex. BM are associated with worse survival for patients with NSCLC but not those with SCLC. Cancer 2016;122:1921-7. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors may experience long-term and late effects from treatment that adversely affect health and limit functioning. Few studies examine lost productivity and disease burden in cancer survivors compared with individuals who have other chronic conditions or by cancer type. METHODS: We identified 4960 cancer survivors and 64,431 other individuals from the 2008-2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey and compared multiple measures of disease burden, including health status and lost productivity, between conditions and by cancer site for cancer survivors. All analyses controlled for the effects of age, sex, race/ethnicity, and number of comorbid conditions. RESULTS: Overall, in adjusted analyses in multiple models, cancer survivors with another chronic disease (heart disease or diabetes) experienced higher levels of burden compared with individuals with a history of cancer only, chronic disease only, and neither cancer, heart disease, nor diabetes across multiple measures (P < .05). Among cancer survivors, individuals with short survival cancers and multiple cancers consistently had the highest levels of burden across multiple measures (P < .0001). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer survivors who have another chronic disease experience more limitations and higher levels of burden across multiple measures. Limitations are particularly severe in cancer survivors with short survival cancer and multiple cancers.

BACKGROUND: Well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma has a favorable prognosis, but patients with multiple recurrences have drastically lower survival. Filipinos in the United States are known to have high rates of thyroid cancer incidence and disease recurrence. To the authors' knowledge, it is unknown whether Filipinos also have higher thyroid cancer mortality rates. METHODS: The authors studied thyroid cancer mortality in Filipino, non-Filipino Asian (NFA), and non-Hispanic white (NHW) adults using US death records (2003-2012) and US Census data. Age-adjusted mortality rates and proportional mortality ratios (PMRs) were calculated. Sex, nativity status, age at death, and educational attainment also were examined. RESULTS: The authors examined 19,940,952 deaths. The age-adjusted mortality rates due to thyroid cancer were highest in Filipinos (1.72 deaths per 100,000 population; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.51-1.95) compared with NFAs (1.03 per 100,000 population; 95% CI, 0.95-1.12) and NHWs (1.17 per 100,000 population; 95% CI, 1.16-1.18). Compared with NHWs, higher proportionate mortality was observed in Filipino women (3-5 times higher) across all age groups, and among Filipino men, the PMR was 2 to 3 times higher in the subgroup aged >55 years. Filipinos who completed a higher educational level had a notably higher PMR (5.0) compared with their counterparts who had not (3.5). CONCLUSIONS: Negative prognostic factors for thyroid cancer traditionally include age >45 years and male sex. The results of the current study demonstrate that Filipinos die of thyroid cancer at higher rates than NFA and NHW individuals of similar ages. Highly educated Filipinos and Filipino women may be especially at risk of poor thyroid cancer outcomes. Filipino ethnicity should be factored into clinical decision making in the management of patients with thyroid cancer. Cancer 2017;123:4860-7. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: In the first CONCORD study, 5-year survival for patients with diagnosed with rectal cancer between 1990 and 1994 was <60%, with large racial disparities noted in the majority of participating states. We have updated these findings to 2009 by examining population-based survival by stage of disease at the time of diagnosis, race, and calendar period. METHODS: Data from the CONCORD-2 study were used to compare survival among individuals aged 15 to 99 years who were diagnosed in 37 states encompassing up to 80% of the US population. We estimated net survival up to 5 years after diagnosis correcting for background mortality with state-specific and race-specific life table. Survival estimates were age-standardized with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. We present survival estimates by race (all, black, and white) for 2001 through 2003 and 2004 through 2009 to account for changes in collecting the data for Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Summary Stage 2000. RESULTS: There was a small increase in 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year net survival between 2001-2003 (84.6%, 70.7%, and 63.2%, respectively), and 2004-2009 (85.1%, 71.5%, and 64.1%, respectively). Black individuals were found to have lower 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival than white individuals in both periods; the absolute difference in survival between black and white individuals declined only for 5-year survival. Black patients had lower 5-year survival than whites at each stage at the time of diagnosis in both time periods. CONCLUSIONS: There was little improvement noted in net survival for patients with rectal cancer, with persistent disparities noted between black and white individuals. Additional investigation is needed to identify and implement effective interventions to ensure the consistent and equitable use of high-quality screening, diagnosis, and treatment to improve survival for patients with rectal cancer.

Upregulation of DJ-1 mRNA is commonly observed in various human cancers such as ductal carcinoma of the breast, non-small cell carcinoma of the lung, pancreatic duct adenocarcinoma, urinary transitional cell carcinoma, and gynecologic carcinoma. At the protein level, intensity and intracellular localization of DJ-1 expression is varied, and the DJ-1 protein regulates cancer progression, clinical aggressiveness, differentiation, cancer cell morphology, and drug sensitivity. Thus, DJ-1 plays a critical role in cancer. Although DJ-1 has an important role within cancer cells, cancer cells secrete DJ-1 outside the cells. DJ-1 may serve as a tumor marker that can be detected from an early stage in the blood, secretory fluids, ascites, or pleural effusion.

BACKGROUND: The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) included provisions to extend dependent health care coverage up to the age of 26 years in 2010. The authors examined the early impact of the ACA (before the implementation of insurance exchanges in 2014) on insurance rates in young adults with cancer, a historically underinsured group. METHODS: Using National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results data for 18 cancer registries, the authors examined insurance rates before (pre) (January 2007-September 2010) versus after (post) (October 2010-December 2012) dependent insurance provisions among young adults aged 18 to 29 years when diagnosed with cancer during 2007 through 2012. Using multivariate generalized mixed effect models, the authors conducted difference-in-differences analysis to examine changes in overall and Medicaid insurance after the ACA among young adults who were eligible (those aged 18-25 years) and ineligible (those aged 26-29 years) for policy changes. RESULTS: Among 39,632 young adult cancer survivors, the authors found an increase in overall insurance rates in those aged 18 to 25 years after the dependent provisions (83.5% for pre-ACA vs 85.4% for post-ACA; P<.01), but not among individuals aged 26 to 29 years (83.4% for pre-ACA vs 82.9% for post-ACA; P = .38). After adjusting for patient sociodemographics and cancer characteristics, the authors found that those aged 18 to 25 years had a 3.1% increase in being insured compared with individuals aged 26 to 29 years (P<.01); however, there were no significant changes noted in Medicaid enrollment (P = .17). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the current study identify an increase in insurance rates for young adults aged 18 to 25 years compared with those aged 26 to 29 years (1.9% vs -0.5%) that was not due to increases in Medicaid enrollment, thereby demonstrating a positive impact of the ACA dependent care provisions on insurance rates in this population.

BACKGROUND: Survivors of pediatric cancer have elevated risks of mortality and morbidity. Many late adverse effects associated with cancer treatment (eg, second cancers and cardiac and pulmonary disease) are also associated with cigarette smoking, and this suggests that survivors who smoke may be at high risk for these conditions. METHODS: This study examined the self-reported smoking status for 9397 adult survivors of childhood cancer across 3 questionnaires (median time interval, 13 years). The smoking prevalence among survivors was compared with the smoking prevalence among siblings and the prevalence expected on the basis of age-, sex-, race-, and calendar time-specific rates in the US population. Multivariable regression models examined characteristics associated with longitudinal smoking patterns across all 3 questionnaires. RESULTS: At the baseline, 19% of survivors were current smokers, whereas 24% of siblings were current smokers, and 29% were expected to be current smokers on the basis of US rates. Current smoking among survivors dropped to 16% and 14% on follow-up questionnaires, with similar decreases in the sibling prevalence and the expected prevalence. Characteristics associated with consistent never-smoking included a higher household income (relative risk [RR], 1.16; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.25), higher education (RR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.22-1.43), and receipt of cranial radiation therapy (RR, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.03-1.14). Psychological distress (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.92) and heavy alcohol drinking (RR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.58-0.71) were inversely associated. Among ever-smokers, a higher income (RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.04-1.32) and education (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.10-1.38) were associated with quitting, whereas cranial radiation (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.76-0.97) and psychological distress (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.72-0.90) were associated with not having quit. The development of adverse health conditions was not associated with smoking patterns. CONCLUSIONS: Despite modest declines in smoking prevalence, the substantial number of consistent current smokers reinforces the need for continued development of effective smoking interventions for survivors.

BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare, accounting for only around 1% of all breast cancers. Most MBCs are hormone-driven. Not only the estrogen receptor (ER), but also other steroid hormone receptors, including the androgen receptor (AR) and progesterone receptor (PgR) are expressed in MBC. AR activation in breast cancer cells facilitates downstream gene expression that drives tumorigenesis in a similar manner to ER. AR-mediated signalling works paradoxically in breast cancer and prostate cancer, and cancer cells expressing the AR are endocrine-sensitive. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of double cancer of MBC and prostate cancer. A 69-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a lump in his left breast in the 1990s. The patient had cT3N3M0, stage IIIC breast cancer, and underwent a mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection. Though adjuvant chemotherapy was administered, he experienced pleural metastasis 2 months after the surgery. Two years after the recurrence during endocrine therapy with oral 5-fluorouracil, he complained of frequent urination. Radiological and histological examinations revealed that the patient had cT3N0M0, stage III primary prostate cancer with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 40.5 ng/mL. Germline mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes were not tested. He received multidisciplinary, continuous therapy for both breast and prostate cancer; however, 5 and 3 years after each diagnosis, respectively, he experienced a deep vein thrombosis in his right leg related to the endocrine therapy. Liver metastasis progressed after he stopped breast cancer therapy. However, long-term disease control had been achieved with anti-estrogen therapy for breast cancer and estrogen replacement therapy for prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Several studies have shown that estrogen exposure after estrogen depletion likely causes apoptosis of ER-positive breast cancer cells. Our findings indicate that this also applies to the environment in male body. AR dominant signaling prevents breast cancer recurrence and metastasis, especially in MBC patients.

BACKGROUND: Impaired physical performance is highly prevalent in older cancer patients and is associated with cancer-related outcomes such as mortality and chemotherapy-related toxicity. Physical performance might already decline prior to the cancer diagnosis due to undiagnosed disease. This study aimed to assess whether the physical performance of community-dwelling individuals prior to cancer diagnosis is worse compared to matched controls who are not diagnosed with cancer. METHODS: The study sample was selected from the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam, a longitudinal study on a nationally representative sample of the Dutch older population. Physical performance of initially cancer-free individuals aged 55-84 years who were diagnosed with cancer during 10 or 20 years of follow-up was compared to the physical performance of controls who were not diagnosed with cancer. For controls, the physical performance measurements of the cycle with a median age closest to the cancer group were used. The time interval between physical performance measurements and the report of cancer was 2 to 4 years. Groups were compared using logistic and linear regression analysis. RESULTS: The study sample included 1735 individuals with a median age of 68.7 [interquartile range 63.3-76.4] years. During follow-up, 414 (23.9%) individuals were diagnosed with cancer. Handgrip strength, gait speed, chair stand ability, chair stand test time and ability to put on and take off a cardigan did not differ between groups. Individuals prior to cancer diagnosis were more likely to complete the tandem balance test. CONCLUSIONS: Physical performance of individuals 2 to 4 years prior to report of cancer diagnosis is not lower compared to controls. This suggests that physical performance may not be influenced by cancer before diagnosis.

PURPOSE: To compare a novel generalized competing event (GCE) model versus the standard Cox proportional hazards regression model for stratifying elderly patients with cancer who are at risk for competing events. METHODS: We identified 84,319 patients with nonmetastatic prostate, head and neck, and breast cancers from the SEER-Medicare database. Using demographic, tumor, and clinical characteristics, we trained risk scores on the basis of GCE versus Cox models for cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. In test sets, we examined the predictive ability of the risk scores on the different causes of death, including second cancer mortality, noncancer mortality, and cause-specific mortality, using Fine-Gray regression and area under the curve. We compared how well models stratified subpopulations according to the ratio of the cumulative cause-specific hazard for cancer mortality to the cumulative hazard for overall mortality (omega) using the Akaike Information Criterion. RESULTS: In each sample, increasing GCE risk scores were associated with increased cancer-specific mortality and decreased competing mortality, whereas risk scores from Cox models were associated with both increased cancer-specific mortality and competing mortality. GCE models created greater separation in the area under the curve for cancer-specific mortality versus noncancer mortality (P < .001), indicating better discriminatory ability between these events. Comparing the GCE model to Cox models of cause-specific mortality or all-cause mortality, the respective Akaike Information Criterion scores were superior (lower) in each sample: prostate cancer, 28.6 versus 35.5 versus 39.4; head and neck cancer, 21.1 versus 29.4 versus 40.2; and breast cancer, 24.6 versus 32.3 versus 50.8. CONCLUSION: Compared with standard modeling approaches, GCE models improve stratification of elderly patients with cancer according to their risk of dying from cancer relative to overall mortality.

BACKGROUND: Muscle sampling is often used as a surrogate for staging quality in patients with bladder cancer. The association of staging quality at diagnosis and survival was examined among patients with bladder cancer. METHODS: The clinical records of all individuals within the Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry with an incident diagnosis of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer in 2004-2005 were reviewed. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, staging quality (presence of muscle in the specimen and mention of muscle in the pathology report), and vital status were recorded. With mixed-effects and competing-risks regression analyses, the association of patient and tumor characteristics with staging quality and cancer-specific survival was quantified. RESULTS: The sample included 1865 patients, 335 urologists, and 27 pathologists. Muscle was reported to be present in 972 (52.1%), was reported to be absent in 564 (30.2%), and was not mentioned in 329 (17.7%) of the initial pathology reports. The presence of muscle did not differ according to the grade or depth of invasion. Mortality was associated with staging quality (P < .05). Among patients with high-grade disease, the 5-year cancer-specific mortality rates were 7.6%, 12.1%, and 18.8% when muscle was present, absent, and not mentioned, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The omission of muscle in the specimen or its mention in the pathology report in nearly half of all diagnostic resections was associated with increased mortality, particularly in patients with high-grade disease. Because urologists cannot reliably discern between high- and low-grade or Ta and T1 disease, it is contended that patients with bladder cancer should undergo adequate muscle sampling at the time of endoscopic resection.

Although increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been observed after chemotherapy and radiotherapy, less is known about radiotherapy-related risks of specific AML subtypes and other specific myeloid neoplasms. We used the US population-based cancer registry data to evaluate risk of myeloid neoplasms among three cohorts of cancer survivors initially treated with radiotherapy only. We included 1-year survivors of first primary thyroid (radioiodine only, stages I-IV; N = 49 879), prostate (excluding stage IV; N = 237 439), or uterine corpus cancers (stage I-II; N = 16 208) diagnosed during 2000-2013. We calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs). Thyroid cancer survivors had significantly elevated risks of total AML (SIR = 2.77, 95% CI: 1.99-3.76), AML with cytogenetic abnormalities (SIR = 3.90, 95% CI: 1.57-8.04), AML with myelodysplasia-related changes (SIR = 2.87, 95% CI: 1.05-6.25), and BCR-ABL1-positive chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) (SIR = 5.38, 95% CI: 2.58-9.89). Irradiated prostate and uterine corpus cancer survivors were at elevated risk for total AML (SIR = 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.27 and SIR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.01-2.87, respectively), AML with cytogenetic abnormalities (SIR = 2.52, 95% CI: 1.84-3.37 and SIR = 7.21, 95% CI: 2.34-16.83, respectively), and acute promyelocytic leukemia (SIR = 3.20, 95% CI: 2.20-4.49 and SIR = 8.88, 95% CI: 2.42-22.73, respectively). In addition, prostate cancer survivors were at increased risk of BCR-ABL1-positive CML (SIR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.52-2.85). Our findings support the importance of diagnostic precision in myeloid neoplasm classification since susceptibility following radiotherapy may vary by myeloid neoplasm subtype, thereby informing risk/benefit discussions in first primary cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: The Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program started in 1996. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report using individual-based data on invitation and participation to analyze breast cancer mortality among screened and nonscreened women in the program. METHODS: Information on dates of invitation, attendance, breast cancer diagnosis, emigration, death, and cause of death was linked by using unique 11-digit personal identification numbers assigned all inhabitants of Norway at birth or immigration. In total, 699,628 women ages 50 to 69 years without prior a diagnosis of breast cancer were invited to the program from 1996 to 2009 and were followed for breast cancer through 2009 and death through 2010. Incidence-based breast cancer mortality rate ratios (MRRs) were compared between the screened and nonscreened cohorts using a Poisson regression model. The MRRs were adjusted for calendar period, attained age, years since inclusion in the cohorts, and self-selection bias. RESULTS: The crude breast cancer mortality rate was 20.7 per 100,000 women-years for the screened cohort compared with 39.7 per 100,000 women-years for the nonscreened cohort, resulting in an MRR of 0.52 (95% confidence interval, 0.47-0.59). The mortality reduction associated with attendance in the program was 43% (MRR, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.64) after adjusting for calendar period, attained age, years after inclusion in the cohort, and self-selection bias. CONCLUSIONS: After 15 years of follow-up, a 43% reduction in mortality was observed among women who attended the national mammographic screening program in Norway.

OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate mortality and cancer incidence of Australian male volunteer firefighters and of subgroups of firefighters by duration of service, era of first service and the number and type of incidents attended. METHODS: Participating fire agencies supplied records of individual volunteer firefighters, including incidents attended. The cohort was linked to the Australian National Death Index and Australian Cancer Database. standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) for cancer were calculated. Firefighters were grouped into tertiles by duration of service and by number of incidents attended and relative mortality ratios and relative incidence ratios calculated. RESULTS: Compared with the general population, there were significant decreases in overall cancer incidence and in most major cancer categories. Prostate cancer incidence was increased compared with the general population, but this was not related to the number of incidents attended. Kidney cancer was associated with increased attendance at fires, particularly structural fires.The overall risk of mortality was significantly decreased, and all major causes of death were significantly reduced for volunteer firefighters. There was evidence of an increased mortality from ischaemic heart disease, with increased attendance at fires. CONCLUSION: Volunteer firefighters have a reduced risk of mortality and cancer incidence compared with the general population, which is likely to be a result of a 'healthy-volunteer' effect and, perhaps, lower smoking rates.

PURPOSE: Family history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an established risk factor for the disease. However, associations of pancreatic cancer with other familial cancers are less clear. We analyzed data from the Queensland Pancreatic Cancer Study (QPCS), an Australian population-based case-control study, to investigate associations between family history of various cancer types and risk of pancreatic cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 591 pancreatic cancer patients and 646 controls, all of whom self-reported the histories of cancer in their first-degree relatives. We used logistic regression to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Based on our results, we conducted a systematic literature review using the Medline (OVID) database to identify articles pertaining to the association between family history of melanoma and risk of pancreatic cancer. A meta-analysis including associations in five published studies, unpublished results from a study co-author and the QPCS results was then performed using the DerSimonian and Laird random-effects model. RESULTS: Cases were more likely than controls to report a family history of pancreatic cancer (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.16-4.19) and melanoma (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.03-2.95), but not of breast, ovarian, respiratory, other gastrointestinal or prostate cancer. Meta-analysis of melanoma family history and pancreatic cancer risk yielded an OR of 1.22 (95% CI 1.00-1.51). CONCLUSIONS: Our results yield further evidence of increased risk of pancreatic cancer in those with family histories of the disease. We also provide suggestive evidence of an association between family history of melanoma and risk of pancreatic cancer.

Plasticity of the cell state has been proposed to drive resistance to multiple classes of cancer therapies, thereby limiting their effectiveness. A high-mesenchymal cell state observed in human tumours and cancer cell lines has been associated with resistance to multiple treatment modalities across diverse cancer lineages, but the mechanistic underpinning for this state has remained incompletely understood. Here we molecularly characterize this therapy-resistant high-mesenchymal cell state in human cancer cell lines and organoids and show that it depends on a druggable lipid-peroxidase pathway that protects against ferroptosis, a non-apoptotic form of cell death induced by the build-up of toxic lipid peroxides. We show that this cell state is characterized by activity of enzymes that promote the synthesis of polyunsaturated lipids. These lipids are the substrates for lipid peroxidation by lipoxygenase enzymes. This lipid metabolism creates a dependency on pathways converging on the phospholipid glutathione peroxidase (GPX4), a selenocysteine-containing enzyme that dissipates lipid peroxides and thereby prevents the iron-mediated reactions of peroxides that induce ferroptotic cell death. Dependency on GPX4 was found to exist across diverse therapy-resistant states characterized by high expression of ZEB1, including epithelial-mesenchymal transition in epithelial-derived carcinomas, TGFbeta-mediated therapy-resistance in melanoma, treatment-induced neuroendocrine transdifferentiation in prostate cancer, and sarcomas, which are fixed in a mesenchymal state owing to their cells of origin. We identify vulnerability to ferroptic cell death induced by inhibition of a lipid peroxidase pathway as a feature of therapy-resistant cancer cells across diverse mesenchymal cell-state contexts.

PURPOSE: This study presents the 2015 nationwide cancer statistics in Korea, including the incidence, survival, prevalence, and mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer incidence data from 1999 to 2015 was obtained from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database and followed until December 31, 2016. Mortality data from 1983 to 2015 were obtained from Statistics Korea. The prevalence was defined as the number of cancer patients alive on January 1, 2016, among all cancer patients diagnosed since 1999. Crude and age-standardized rates (ASRs) for incidence, mortality and prevalence and 5-year relative survivals were also calculated. RESULTS: Herein, 214,701 and 76,855 Koreans were newly diagnosed and died from cancer in 2015, respectively. The ASRs for cancer incidence and mortality in 2015 were 258.9 and 82.0 per 100,000, respectively. The overall cancer incidence rate has increased significantly by 3.4% annually from 1999 to 2012, and started to decrease after 2012 (2012-2015, annual percent change, -6.1%). However, the overall cancer mortality has decreased 2.7% annually since 2002. The 5-year relative survival rate for patients diagnosed with cancer between 2011 and 2015 was 70.7%, an improvement from the 41.2% for patients diagnosed between 1993 and 1995. CONCLUSION: Age-standardized cancer incidence rates have decreased since 2012 and mortality rates have declined since 2002; however, the 5-year survival rates have improved remarkably from 1993-1995 to 2011-2015 in Korea.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether light alcohol drinking increases the risk of cancer by using a meta-analysis of cohort studies because the newly revised 2015 European Code against Cancer fourth edition on alcohol and cancer was based on critical flaws in the interpretation and citation of the previous meta-analyses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed and EMBASE were searched in April, 2016. Two authors independently reviewed and selected cohort studies on the association between very light (</= 0.5 drink/day), light (</= 1 drink/day), or moderate drinking (1-2 drinks/day) and the risk of cancer incidence and mortality. A pooled relative riskwith its 95% confidence intervalwas calculated by a random-effects meta-analysis. Main outcome measures were cancer incidence and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 60 cohort studies from 135 articles were included in the final analysis. Very light drinking or light drinking was not associated with the incidence of most cancers except for female breast cancer in women and male colorectal cancer. Conversely, light drinking was associated with a decreased incidence of both female and male lung cancer significantly and both female and male thyroid cancer marginally significantly. Moderate drinking significantly increased the incidence of male colorectal cancer and female breast cancer,whereas it decreased the incidence of both female and male hematologic malignancy. CONCLUSION: We found that very light or light alcohol drinking was not associated with the risk of most of the common cancers except for the mild increase in the incidence of breast cancer in women and colorectal cancer in men.

PURPOSE: Preexisting diabetes is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in cancer. We examined the impact of incident cancer on the long-term outcomes of diabetes. METHODS: Using the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink, we identified three cohorts of diabetes patients subsequently diagnosed with breast, colorectal, or prostate cancer, each matched to diabetic noncancer controls. Patients were required to have survived at least 1 year after cancer diagnosis (cases) or a matched index date (controls), and were followed up to 10 years for incident microvascular and macrovascular complications and mortality. Multivariate competing risks regression analyses were used to compare outcomes between cancer patients and controls. RESULTS: Overall, there were 3382 cancer patients and 11,135 controls with 59,431 person-years of follow-up. In adjusted analyses, there were no statistically significant (p </= 0.05) differences in diabetes complication rates between cancer patients and their controls in any of the three cancer cohorts. Combined, cancer patients were less likely (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.88; 95% CI = 0.79-0.98) to develop retinopathy. Cancer patients were more likely to die of any cause (including cancer), but prostate cancer patients were less likely to die of causes associated with diabetes (HR 0.61; 95% CI = 0.43-0.88). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: There is no evidence that incident cancer had an adverse impact on the long-term outcomes of preexisting diabetes. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: These findings are important for cancer survivors with preexisting diabetes because they suggest that substantial improvements in the relative survival of several of the most common types of cancer are not undermined by excess diabetes morbidity and mortality.

BACKGROUND: Cancer imposes substantial burdens on cancer suffers, their families and the health system, especially in the end of life (EOL) of care patients. There are few developing country studies of EOL health care costs and no specialist studies of the disparities in cancer treatment and care costs by geographical location in China. We sought to examine geographical disparities in the types of cancer treatments and care costs during the last 3 months of life for Chinese cancer patients. METHODS: Using snowball sampling and face-to-face interviews, field research was conducted with a specialist questionnaire. Data were collected on 792 cancer patients who died between July 2013 and June 2016 in China. Total EOL health care costs were modeled using generalized linear models (GLMs) with log link and gamma distribution. RESULTS: Total health care costs were highest for urban (US$12,501) and western region (US$9808) patients and lowest for rural (US$5996) and central region (US$5814) patients. Our study revealed about 40% of the health care expenses occur in the last three months of life, and was mainly driven by hospital costs that accounted for about 70% of EOL expenditures. Patients faced out-of-pocket expenses for health care, with the ability to borrow from family and friends also impacting the type of treatment and health facility. Life-extending treatments per cancer patient was about two times that of patients receiving conservative treatments.Urban patients were more likely to receive life-extending treatments, financed by higher incomes and a greater capacity to borrow from family and friends to bridge the gap between health insurance reimbursements and out-of-pocket expenditures. Cancer patients in western region and urban area were significantly more likely to access hospice care. CONCLUSIONS: We found significant urban-rural and regional disparities in EOL types of cancer treatment, utilization of medical care and the health care expenditures. The EOL cancer care costs imposed heavy economic burdens in China.We recommend better clinical guidelines, improved EOL conversations and fuller information on treatment regimes among patients, family caregivers and doctors. Policies and information should pay more attention to palliative care options and the socio-cultural context of cancer care decision-making by family.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to determine the association between self-reported birth weight and incident cancer in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study cohort, a large multiethnic cohort of postmenopausal women. METHODS: 65,850 women reported their birth weight by category (<6 lbs, 6-7 lbs 15 oz, 8-9 lbs 15 oz, and >/=10 lbs). All self-reported, incident cancers were adjudicated by study staff. We used Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate crude and adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) for associations between birth weight and: (1) all cancer sites combined, (2) gynecologic cancers, and (3) several site-specific cancer sites. RESULTS: After adjustments, birth weight was positively associated with the risk of lung cancer (p=0.01), and colon cancer (p=0.04). An inverse trend was observed between birth weight and risk for leukemia (p=0.04). A significant trend was not observed with breast cancer risk (p=0.67); however, women born weighing >/=10 lbs were less likely to develop breast cancer compared to women born between 6 lbs-7 lbs 15 oz (aHR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63, 0.94). CONCLUSION: Birth weight category appears to be significantly associated with the risk of any postmenopausal incident cancer, though the direction of the association varies by cancer type.

Literature focusing on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) by cancer site among women only is scarce. This study examines HRQoL of breast cancer (BC) survivors compared with female survivors of other cancers, and to understand which subgroups of BC survivors were particularly at risk of reduced HRQoL. We placed emphasis on young (<50 years) and recently diagnosed (</=5 years) survivors, where the deficits in HRQoL were most pronounced. The cross-sectional study consisted of 2,224 BC survivors, 8,504 non-cancer controls and 2,205 other cancer survivors in the Karma study. We examined HRQoL differences using linear regression analyses in the whole cohort and in a subset of young and recently diagnosed BC survivors (n = 242) and female survivors of other cancers (n = 140) with comparable ages at diagnosis (43.6 vs 43.6, p = 0.917) and time since diagnosis (2.3 vs 2.8 years, p < 0.001). HRQoL was assessed using the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire. While only cognitive functioning was significantly compromised in BC survivors compared with survivors of other cancers when women of all ages were included, young BC survivors reported significantly lower HRQoL on multiple functional scales (global quality of life, emotional, role, social and cognitive functioning) and experienced more fatigue and insomnia. BC survivors with any prior medical history of mental disorders reported poorer HRQoL than those without such a history. We also observed a close-knit relationship between tumor and treatment characteristics. BC survivors perform poorly in HRQoL in comparison with female survivors of other cancers. Our results emphasize the importance of age- and gender-appropriate comparison groups.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the cost-sharing provision of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was to reduce financial barriers for preventive services, including screening for colorectal cancer (CRC) and breast cancer (BC) among privately and Medicare-insured individuals. Whether the provision has affected CRC and BC screening prevalence is unknown. The current study investigated whether CRC and BC screening prevalence among privately and Medicare-insured adults by socioeconomic status (SES) changed before and after the ACA. METHODS: Data obtained from the National Health Interview Survey pertaining to privately and Medicare-insured adults from 2008 (before the ACA) and 2013 (after the ACA) were used. There were 15,786 adults aged 50 to 75 years in the CRC screening analysis and 14,530 women aged >/=40 years in the BC screening analysis. Changes in guideline-recommended screening between 2008 and 2013 by SES were expressed as the prevalence difference (PD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) adjusted for demographics, insurance, income, education, body mass index, and having a usual provider. RESULTS: Overall, CRC screening prevalence increased from 57.3% to 61.2% between 2008 and 2013 (P<.001). Adjusted CRC screening prevalence during the corresponding period increased in low-income (PD, 5.9; 95% CI, 1.8 to 10.2), least-educated (PD, 7.2; 95% CI, 0.9 to 13.5), and Medicare-insured (PD, 6.2; 95% CI, 1.7 to 10.7) individuals, but not in high-income, most-educated, and privately insured respondents. BC screening remained unchanged overall (70.5% in 2008 vs 70.2% in 2013) and in the low SES groups. CONCLUSIONS: Increases in CRC screening prevalence between 2008 and 2013 were confined to respondents with low SES. These findings may in part reflect the ACA's removal of financial barriers.

PURPOSE: Psychological distress is related to poorer functioning and reduced quality of life in patients with advanced cancer and may have untoward influences on treatment decisions. Current research on factors associated with this distress is limited, making targeted interventions to reduce it suboptimal. We examined the relationships between two goal-related expectancies and two of the most common symptoms of psychological distress in patients living with advanced cancer: anxiety and depressive symptoms. METHODS: Patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, or melanoma (N = 84) completed measures of anxiety, depressive symptoms, optimism, hope, and prediction for 12-month survival. Oncologists provided prediction for patient 12-month survival and patient performance status. RESULTS: Hope, but not optimism, was associated with less severe depressive symptoms (beta = - 0.42). Conversely, optimism, but not hope, was associated with less severe anxiety symptoms (beta = - 0.36). CONCLUSIONS: Hope and optimism appear to be associated with different aspects of psychological distress in patients living with advanced cancer. This may be explained by different appraisals of the uncertainty and distress that are associated with living with advanced-stage cancer. Hope- or optimism-focused interventions can be tailored to help alleviate specific aspects of psychological distress among these patients.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential of circulating cytokines and chemokines as biomarkers of cancer mortality risk in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: Male participants in the Veterans Affairs RA registry were followed up from the time of enrollment until death or December 2013. Cytokines and chemokines were measured in banked serum obtained at the time of enrollment, using a bead-based multiplex assay, and a previously developed cytokine score was calculated. Vital status and cause of death were determined through the National Death Index. Associations of cytokines with cancer mortality were examined using multivariable competing-risks regression. RESULTS: Among 1,190 men with RA, 60 cancer deaths (30 of which were attributable to lung cancer) occurred over 5,307 patient-years of follow-up. The patients had a mean age of 64.5 years, had established disease (median duration 8.7 years), were seropositive for rheumatoid factor (81%) or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (77%), and frequently had a history of smoking (82% current or former). Seven of 17 analytes examined were individually associated with cancer mortality. The cytokine score was associated with overall cancer (subhazard ratio [SHR] 1.42, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.08-1.85) and lung cancer (SHR 1.86, 95% CI 1.57-2.19) mortality in multivariable analyses. Those in the highest quartile of cytokine scores had a >2-fold increased risk of overall cancer mortality (P = 0.039) and a 6-fold increased risk of lung cancer mortality (P = 0.028) relative to the lowest quartile. A synergistic interaction between current smoking and high cytokine score was observed. CONCLUSION: Serum cytokines and chemokines are associated with cancer and lung cancer mortality in men with RA, independent of multiple factors including age, smoking status, and prevalent cancer.

Allogeneic Blood and Marrow Transplant (BMT) survivors are at high risk of secondary cancers. Although current guidelines endorse survivors following Country-specific general population screening recommendations to mitigate this risk, little is known about cancer screening adherence in Australian BMT survivors. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 441 BMT survivors who were >1 year post transplant, to explore rates of screening for secondary cancers and to identify barriers to cancer screening recommendations. Survey instruments included the Sydney Post-BMT Survey, FACT-BMT, DASS 21, The Chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD) Activity Assessment-Patient Self-Report (Form B), the Lee Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale, Fear of Cancer Recurrence Scale, and The Post Traumatic Growth Inventory. Fifty-seven percent of respondents were male, median age 54 years, and 40% were >6 years post-BMT. Rates of cancer screening adherence were as follows: cervical 63.4%, breast 53.3%, skin 52.4%, and bowel 32.3%. Older BMT survivors and those >2 years post transplant were more likely to undergo cancer screening. Improved quality of life was associated with screening for skin, breast, and cervical cancer. Fear of cancer recurrence negatively impacted on cervical screening. For those who had not undergone screening, the majority reported not being advised to do so by their treatment team. This study is the largest and most comprehensive to date exploring cancer screening adherence in BMT survivors in Australia. These data provide the basis for health service reform to better meet the needs of BMT survivors and provide evidence to support counseling and education of both patients and professionals.

In this article, the American Cancer Society provides the estimated number of new cancer cases and deaths for blacks in the United States and the most recent data on cancer incidence, mortality, survival, screening, and risk factors for cancer. Incidence data are from the National Cancer Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, and mortality data are from the National Center for Health Statistics. Approximately 189,910 new cases of cancer and 69,410 cancer deaths will occur among blacks in 2016. Although blacks continue to have higher cancer death rates than whites, the disparity has narrowed for all cancers combined in men and women and for lung and prostate cancers in men. In contrast, the racial gap in death rates has widened for breast cancer in women and remained level for colorectal cancer in men. The reduction in overall cancer death rates since the early 1990s translates to the avoidance of more than 300,000 deaths among blacks. In men, incidence rates from 2003 to 2012 decreased for all cancers combined (by 2.0% per year) as well as for the top 3 cancer sites (prostate, lung, and colorectal). In women, overall rates during the corresponding time period remained unchanged, reflecting increasing trends in breast cancer combined with decreasing trends in lung and colorectal cancer rates. Five-year relative survival is lower for blacks than whites for most cancers at each stage of diagnosis. The extent to which these disparities reflect unequal access to health care versus other factors remains an active area of research. Progress in reducing cancer death rates could be accelerated by ensuring equitable access to prevention, early detection, and high-quality treatment. CA Cancer J Clin 2016;66:290-308.

Current treatment regimens for gastric cancer are not adequate. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) may be a key driving factor for growth and metastasis of this tumor type. In contrast to the conventional clonal evolution hypothesis, CSCs can initiate tumor formation, self-renew, and differentiate into tumor-propagating cells. Because gastric cancer can originate from CSCs, it is necessary to review current targets of signaling pathways for CSCs in gastric cancer that are being studied in clinical trials. These pathways are known to regulate the self-renewal and differentiation process in gastric CSCs. A better understanding of the clinical results of trials that target gastric CSCs will lead to better outcomes for patients with gastric cancer. Cancer 2017;123:1303-1312. (c) 2017 The Authors.

BACKGROUND: The most common, persistent concern among survivors of breast cancer is the fear that their disease will return, yet to the authors' knowledge, few interventions targeting fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) have been developed to date. The current pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a home-delivered cognitive bias modification intervention to reduce FCR. The intervention, called Attention and Interpretation Modification for Fear of Breast Cancer Recurrence (AIM-FBCR), targeted 2 types of cognitive biases (ie, attention and interpretation biases). METHODS: A total of 110 survivors of breast cancer were randomized to receive 8 sessions of 1 of 2 versions of AIM-FBCR or a control condition program. Computer-based assessments of cognitive biases and a self-report measure of FCR were administered before the intervention, after the intervention, and 3 months after the intervention. RESULTS: Improvements in health worries (P = .019) and interpretation biases (rates of threat endorsement [P<.001] and reaction times for threat rejection [P = .007]) were found in those survivors who received AIM-FBCR compared with the control arm. Although only 26% of participants who screened into the study agreed to participate, the trial otherwise appeared feasible and acceptable, with 83% of those who initiated the intervention completing at least 5 of 8 sessions, and 90% reporting satisfaction with the computer-based program used. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current pilot study suggest the promise of AIM-FBCR in reducing FCR in survivors of breast cancer. Future research should attempt to replicate these findings in a larger-scale trial using a more sophisticated, user-friendly program and additional measures of improvement in more diverse samples.

PURPOSE: This study presents the 2014 nationwide cancer statistics in Korea, including cancer incidence, survival, prevalence, and mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer incidence data from 1999 to 2014 was obtained from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database and followed until December 31, 2015. Mortality data from 1983 to 2014 were obtained from Statistics Korea. The prevalence was defined as the number of cancer patients alive on January 1, 2015, among all cancer patients diagnosed since 1999. Crude and age-standardized rates (ASRs) for incidence, mortality, prevalence, and 5-year relative survivals were also calculated. RESULTS: In 2014, 217,057 and 76,611 Koreans were newly diagnosed and died from cancer respectively. The ASRs for cancer incidence and mortality in 2014 were 270.7 and 85.1 per 100,000, respectively. The all-cancer incidence rate has increased significantly by 3.4% annually from 1999 to 2012, and started to decrease after 2012 (2012-2014; annual percent change, -6.6%). However, overall cancer mortality has decreased 2.7% annually since 2002. The 5-year relative survival rate for patients diagnosed with cancer between 2010 and 2014 was 70.3%, an improvement from the 41.2% for patients diagnosed between 1993 and 1995. CONCLUSION: Age-standardized cancer incidence rates have decreased since 2012 and mortality rates have also declined since 2002, while 5-year survival rates have improved remarkably from 1993-1995 to 2010-2014 in Korea.

OBJECTIVES: Solid neoplasms can be directly responsible for organ failures at the time of diagnosis or relapse. The management of such specific complications relies on urgent chemotherapy and eventual instrumental or surgical procedures, combined with advanced life support. We conducted a multicenter study to address the prognosis of this condition. DESIGN: A multicenter retrospective (2001-2015) chart review. SETTING: Medical and respiratory ICUs. PATIENTS: Adult patients who received urgent chemotherapy in the ICU for organ failure related to solid neoplasms were included. The modalities of chemotherapy, requirements of adjuvant instrumental or surgical procedures, and organ supports were collected. Endpoints were short- and long-term survival rates. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six patients were included. Lung cancer was the most common malignancy distributed into small cell lung cancer (n = 57) and non-small cell lung cancer (n = 33). The main reason for ICU admission was acute respiratory failure in 111 patients (81.6%), of whom 89 required invasive mechanical ventilation. Compression and tissue infiltration by tumor cells were the leading mechanisms resulting in organ involvement in 78 (57.4%) and 47 (34.6%) patients. The overall in-ICU, in-hospital, 6-month, and 1-year mortality rates were 37%, 58%, 74%, and 88%, respectively. Small cell lung cancer was identified as an independent predictor of hospital survival. However, this gain in survival was not sustained since the 1-year survival rates of small cell lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and non-lung cancer patients all dropped below 20%. CONCLUSIONS: Urgent chemotherapy along with aggressive management of organ failures in the ICU can be lifesaving in very selected cancer patients, most especially with small cell lung cancer, although the long-term survival is hardly sustainable.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study is to evaluate the performance characteristics of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) staging recommendations for breast cancer with regard to the detection of lung, bone, and liver metastases. METHODS: Surveillance, epidemiology, and end points (SEER) database (2010-2015) was accessed, and patients with breast cancer and complete information about T stage and clinical N stage, ER status, Her2 status, and metastatic sites were extracted. Performance characteristics evaluated for the current study included sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), number needed to investigate (NNI), and accuracy. RESULTS: A total of 239,196 patients were included in the analysis. For the overall cohort, the required PPV (for the recognition of lung metastases) is 10.6% and NNI to detect one case of lung metastasis is 9.4. Likewise, PPV (for the recognition of bone metastases) is 18.6% and NNI to detect one case of bone metastasis is 5.3. Moreover, PPV (for the recognition of liver metastases) is 7.6% and NNI to detect one case of liver metastasis is 13.1. When changing the threshold for baseline imaging to includeT2N1 patients, a better balance between sensitivity and specificity among ER+/Her2- patients (> 92% for both sensitivity and specificity for the three metastatic sites) was observed. On the other hand, the proposed change improved sensitivity while it lowers significantly the specificity among Her2+ and triple negative subtypes (specificity < 84% for Her2+ disease for the three metastatic sites; specificity < 87% for triple negative disease for the three metastatic sites). CONCLUSION: The current NCCN recommendations for breast cancer staging have an excellent NPV and miss only few patients with lung, liver, or bone metastases. Future studies incorporating the subtype of breast cancer as a determinant of staging pathway is needed.

BACKGROUND: African American women have lower 5-year cancer survival rates than non-Latino White women. Differences in perceived benefits of early cancer detection among racial/ethnic groups may affect cancer-screening behaviors. This study assessed correlates of perceived benefits of early breast, cervical and colorectal cancer detection among 513 African American women. METHODS: Using a community-partnered participatory research approach, we conducted a survey on cancer screening, risk behaviors, and related knowledge and attitudes among African American parishioners at 11 churches in South Los Angeles, a neighborhood that experiences one of the highest cancer mortality rates in California. RESULTS: African American women who participated in this study were more likely to believe that chances for survival are very good or good after early detection of breast cancer (74%) than after early detection of colorectal (51%) and cervical cancer (52%). Multivariate analyses show that perceived benefit of early cancer detection is associated with higher cancer knowledge and having discussed one's cancer risk with a doctor. CONCLUSIONS: Given that 5-year survival rates for early stage breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer range from 84% to 93%, our data suggest that a substantial proportion of African American women in South Los Angeles are not aware of the benefits of early detection, particularly of colorectal and cervical cancers. Programs that increase cancer knowledge and encourage a discussion of individual's cancer risk with a doctor may be able to increase perceived benefit of early detection, a construct that has been shown to be associated with cancer screening in some studies.

BACKGROUND: Esophagogastric cancer is the fifth most common malignancy and its incidence is increasing. The disease progresses quickly and five-year survival rates are poor. Treatment with palliative intent is provided for the majority of patients but there remains a lack of empirical evidence on the most effective service models to support esophagogastric cancer patients. OBJECTIVES: The overall objective of this systematic review was to synthesize the best available evidence on the experiences and perceptions of patients and health professionals with regard to the care of people diagnosed with palliative esophagogastric cancer. INCLUSION CRITERIA TYPES OF PARTICIPANTS: The review considered studies that included patients diagnosed with palliative esophagogastric cancer and any health professionals involved in the delivery of palliative care to this patient group in a hospital, home or community setting. PHENOMENA OF INTEREST: The review considered studies that investigated the experiences and perceptions of people diagnosed with palliative esophagogastric cancer and staff working with these people. CONTEXT: Studies that were carried out in any setting, including in-patient and outpatient areas, specialist cancer and non-specialist palliative care services and those were any patient were in receipt or had experiences of palliative care services were considered. All types of health practitioners delivering palliative care to esophagogastric cancer patients were considered. TYPES OF STUDIES: Studies that focused on qualitative data, including, but not limited to, designs such as phenomenology, grounded theory, ethnography, action research, feminist research and narrative approaches were considered. Mixed methods studies were considered in the review only if qualitative findings were reported separately. SEARCH STRATEGY: A three-step search strategy was utilized. A total 11 databases were searched for studies from 2000 onward, followed by hand searching of reference lists. METHODOLOGICAL QUALITY: Methodological quality was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument critical appraisal tool (JBI-QARI). DATA EXTRACTION: Qualitative findings were extracted using the JBI-QARI data extraction Instrument. DATA SYNTHESIS: Qualitative research findings were pooled using a pragmatic meta-aggregative approach. RESULTS: The review included two publications. There were 46 findings which were aggregated into four categories and one overall synthesized finding: "In addition to support for physical needs, patients need support that takes into account changing life situations to achieve the best quality of life." CONCLUSIONS: The review shows that patients value services and support that addresses their complex, fluctuating and highly individual needs. No evidence was uncovered regarding how these services should be designed and delivered.

BACKGROUND: The authors evaluated the efficacy, patterns of failure, and toxicity of stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for patients with medically inoperable, clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a prospective clinical trial with 7 years of follow-up. Clinical staging was performed according to the seventh edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging system. METHODS: Eligible patients with histologically confirmed NSCLC of clinical stage I as determined using positron emission tomography staging were treated with SABR (50 grays in 4 fractions). The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Patients were followed with computed tomography and/or positron emission tomography/computed tomography every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and then annually thereafter. RESULTS: A total of 65 patients were eligible for analysis. The median age of the patients was 71 years, and the median follow-up was 7.2 years. A total of 18 patients (27.7%) developed disease recurrence at a median of 14.5 months (range, 4.3-71.5 months) after SABR. Estimated incidences of local, regional, and distant disease recurrence using competing risk analysis were 8.1%, 10.9%, and 11.0%, respectively, at 5 years and 8.1%, 13.6%, and 13.8%, respectively, at 7 years. A second primary lung carcinoma developed in 12 patients (18.5%) at a median of 35 months (range, 5-67 months) after SABR. Estimated 5-year and 7-year progression-free survival rates were 49.5% and 38.2%, respectively; the corresponding overall survival rates were 55.7% and 47.5%, respectively. Three patients (4.6%) experienced grade 3 treatment-related adverse events. No patients developed grade 4 or 5 adverse events (toxicity was graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [version 3.0]). CONCLUSIONS: With long-term follow-up, the results of the current prospective study demonstrated outstanding local control and low toxicity after SABR in patients with clinical stage I NSCLC. Regional disease recurrence and distant metastases were the dominant manifestations of failure. Surveillance for second primary lung carcinoma is recommended. Cancer 2017;123:3031-39.

BACKGROUND: To evaluate whether progress continues in identifying more effective treatments for children and adolescents with cancer, the authors examined both overall and disease-specific childhood cancer mortality rates for the United States, focusing on data from 2000 to 2010. METHODS: Age-adjusted US mortality trends from 1975 to 2010 were estimated using joinpoint regression analysis. Analyses of annual percentage change (APC) were performed on the same diagnostic groupings for the period restricted to 2000 through 2010 for groupings ages <20 years, <15 years, and 15 to 19 years. RESULTS: After a plateau in mortality rates during 1998 to 2002 (APC, 0.3%), the annual decline in childhood cancer mortality from 2002 to 2010 (APC, -2.4%) was similar to that observed from 1975 to 1998 (APC, -2.7%). Statistically significant declines in mortality rates from 2000 to 2010 were noted for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, neuroblastoma, central nervous system cancers, and gonadal cancers. From 2000 to 2010, the rates of decline in mortality for the group ages 15 to 19 years generally were equal to or greater than the rates of decline for the group ages birth to 14 years. Improvements in treatment since 1975 resulted >45,000 cancer deaths averted through 2010. CONCLUSIONS: Cancer mortality for both children and adolescents declined from 2000 to 2010, with significant declines observed for multiple cancer types. However, greater than 1900 cancer deaths still occur each year among children and adolescents in the United States, and many survivors experience long-term effects that limit their quality of life. Continued research directed toward identifying more effective treatments that produce fewer long-term sequelae is critical to address these remaining challenges.

Cancer vaccines have great potential in the fight against metastatic malignancies. Current anti-tumor immunotherapy is hindered by existing tolerance to tumor-associated antigens (TAA) and tumor escape using various mechanisms, highlighting the need for improved targets for immunotherapy. The cancer-testis antigen CTCFL/BORIS was discovered 16 years ago and possesses all features necessary for an ideal TAA. Recently CTCFL/BORIS has received additional attention as a target expressed in cancer stem cells (CSC). These cells drive tumor growth recurrence, metastasis, and treatment resistance. CTCFL/BORIS silencing leads to senescence and death of CSC. Therefore, an immunotherapeutic strategy that targets CTCFL/BORIS may lead to the selective destruction of CSC and potential eradication of metastatic disease. The high immunotherapeutic potential of CTCFL/BORIS antigen was shown in a stringent 4T1 mouse model of breast cancer. Using these highly metastatic, poorly immunogenic carcinoma cells inoculated into T-helper2 prone mice, we showed that DC fed with recombinant CTCFL/BORIS as an immunogen inhibited tumor growth and reduced the number of metastases in distant organs. About 20% of CTCFL/BORIS immunized animals were tumor free. 50% of animals remained metastasis free. Those having metastasis showed at least tenfold fewer metastases compared to controls. In a rat model of breast cancer, we showed that alphavirus-based CTCFL/BORIS immunotherapy was capable of cancer elimination as we were able to cure 50% of animals. Based on the above data, we believe that translation of CTCFL/BORIS-targeting immunotherapeutic strategies to the clinic will provide new avenues for improving survival of breast cancer patients with advanced metastatic disease.

BACKGROUND: Early-life socioeconomic status (SES) may play a role in cancer risk in adulthood. However, measuring SES retrospectively presents challenges. Parental occupation on the birth certificate is a novel method of ascertaining early-life SES that has not been applied in cancer epidemiology. METHODS: For a Baby-Boom cohort born from 1945-1959 in two Utah counties, individual-level Nam-Powers SES (Np-SES) was derived from parental industry/occupation reported on birth certificates. Neighborhood SES was estimated from average household income of census tract at birth. Cancer incidence was determined by linkage to Utah Cancer Registry records through the Utah Population Database. Hazard ratios (HR) for cancer risk by SES quartile were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS: Females with low Np-SES at birth had lower risk of breast cancer compared with those in the highest Np-SES group [HRQ1/Q4 = 0.83; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72-0.97; HRQ2/Q4 = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.69-0.96]. Np-SES was inversely associated with melanoma (HRQ1/Q4 = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.67-0.98) and prostate cancer (HRQ1/Q4 = 0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.88). Women born into lower SES neighborhoods had significantly increased risk for invasive cervical cancer (HRQ1/Q4 = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.12-1.85; HRQ2/Q4 = 1.33; 95% CI, 1.04-1.72). Neighborhood SES had similar effects for melanoma and prostate cancers, but was not associated with female breast cancer. We found no association with SES for pancreas, lung, and colon and rectal cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Individual SES derived from parental occupation at birth was associated with altered risk for several cancer sites. IMPACT: This novel methodology can contribute to improved understanding of the role of early-life SES on cancer risk. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 26(1); 75-84. (c)2016 AACR.

The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) is key in the synthesis of leukotrienes, which are potent proinflammatory lipid mediators involved in chronic inflammatory diseases including cancer. 5-LO is expressed in immune cells but also found in cancer cells. Although the role of 5-LO in tumor cells is beginning to emerge, with the notion that tumor-promoting functions are attributed to its products, the function of 5-LO in the tumor microenvironment remains unclear. To understand the role of 5-LO and its products in the tumor microenvironment, we analyzed its expression and function in tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TAMs were generated by coculturing primary human macrophages (MPhi) with human MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells, which caused cell death of cancer cells followed by phagocytosis of cell debris by MPhi. Expression and activity of 5-LO in TAMs were reduced upon coculture with cancer cells. Downregulation of 5-LO in TAMs required tumor cell death and the direct contact between MPhi and dying cancer cells via Mer tyrosine kinase. Subsequently, upregulation of proto-oncogene c-Myb in TAMs induced a stable transcriptional repression of 5-LO. Reduced 5-LO expression in TAMs was mechanistically coupled to an attenuated T cell recruitment. In primary TAMs from human and murine breast tumors, 5-LO expression was absent or low when compared with monocyte-derived MPhi. Our data reveal that 5-LO, which is required for leukotriene production and subsequent T cell recruitment, is downregulated in TAMs through Mer tyrosine kinase-dependent recognition of apoptotic cancer cells. Mechanistically, we noticed transcriptional repression of 5-LO by proto-oncogene c-Myb and conclude that loss of stromal 5-LO expression favors tumor progression.

BACKGROUND: Overall, cervical cancer survival in the United States has been reported to be among the highest in the world, despite slight decreases over the last decade. Objective of the current study was to describe cervical cancer survival trends among US women and examine differences by race and stage. METHODS: This study used data from the CONCORD-2 study to compare survival among women (aged 15-99 years) diagnosed in 37 states covering 80% of the US population. Survival was adjusted for background mortality (net survival) with state- and race-specific life tables and was age-standardized with the International Cancer Survival Standard weights. Five-year survival was compared by race (all races, blacks, and whites). Two time periods, 2001-2003 and 2004-2009, were considered because of changes in how the staging variable was collected. RESULTS: From 2001 to 2009, 90,620 women were diagnosed with invasive cervical cancer. The proportion of cancers diagnosed at a regional or distant stage increased over time in most states. Overall, the 5-year survival was 63.5% in 2001-2003 and 62.8% in 2004-2009. The survival was lower for black women versus white women in both calendar periods and in most states; black women had a higher proportion of distant-stage cancers. CONCLUSIONS: The stability of the overall survival over time and the persistent differences in survival between white and black women in all US states suggest that there is a need for targeted interventions and improved access to screening, timely treatment, and follow-up care, especially among black women.

BACKGROUND: Many young adult female cancer survivors (YAFCS) are at risk of experiencing premature menopause. The current study characterized the posttreatment fertility information needs, reproductive concerns, and decisional conflict regarding future options for posttreatment fertility preservation (FP) among YAFCS. METHODS: Participants completed a Web-based, anonymous survey between February and March 2015. The survey included investigator-designed questions of perceived information needs, the Reproductive Concerns After Cancer Scale, and the Decisional Conflict Scale. Analyses included Pearson correlation coefficients, independent-sample Student t tests, and multiple regression. RESULTS: There was a total of 346 participants with an average age of 29.9 years (SD = 4.1 years) who were 4.9 years from treatment (SD = 5.4 years [range, 0-27 years]). The main analyses focused on a subgroup of YAFCS with uncertain fertility status who had not previously undergone/attempted FP and either wanted future children or were unsure (179 women). Across fertility information topics, 43% to 62% of participants reported unmet information needs. The greatest reproductive concerns were related to fertility potential and the health of future offspring. The regression model controlled for a priori covariates including current age, age at treatment completion, income, relationship status, nulliparity, and prior fertility evaluation. Greater unmet information needs were found to be related to greater decisional conflict (beta = .43; p<.001); greater reproductive concerns were associated at the trend level (beta = .14, p = .08; F[8,118] = 6.42, p<.001). CONCLUSIONS: YAFCS with limited awareness or knowledge of their risk of experiencing premature menopause and FP options reported higher levels of decisional conflict regarding future FP. Posttreatment survivorship care should include comprehensive reproductive health counseling, including posttreatment FP options and family-building alternatives. Cancer 2016;122:2101-9.

BACKGROUND: This study examined the association between the body mass index (BMI) in late adolescence and the risk of colon and rectal cancer. METHODS: This study analyzed a cohort of 1,087,358 Jewish men and 707,212 Jewish women who underwent health examinations at the ages of 16 to 19 years between 1967 and 2002 and were followed by linkage to the national cancer registry up to 2012. Cox regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for cancer according to age- and sex-adjusted BMI percentiles from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (overweight, 85th percentile to <95th percentile; obesity, >/=95th percentile). RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 23 years, 2967 incidence cases of colorectal cancer, including 1977 among men (1403 in the colon and 574 in the rectum) and 990 among women (764 in the colon and 226 in the rectum), were identified. Overweight and obesity were associated with the risk for colon cancer among both men (HR for overweight, 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.28-1.84; HR for obesity, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.15-2.06; statistically significant from a BMI of 23.4 kg/m(2) [spline analysis]) and women (HR for overweight, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.22-1.93; HR for obesity, 1.51; 95% CI, 0.89-2.57; significant from a BMI of 23.6 kg/m(2) ). Obesity, but not overweight, was associated with a risk for rectal cancer among men (HR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.11-2.65; significant from a BMI of 29.6 kg/m(2) ) and women (HR, 2.03; 95% CI, 0.90-4.58; significant from a BMI of 30.6 kg/m(2) ). CONCLUSIONS: Being overweight or obese in adolescence was associated with an increased risk of subsequent colon cancers in men and women, whereas obesity was associated with rectal cancer.

This study examines the relation between perceived cognitive and physical threat after a cancer diagnosis and posttraumatic growth (PTG). In total, 169 breast, prostate, and colorectal cancer survivors completed questionnaires. Hierarchical regression models found after controlling for demographic and medical variables, depression, anxiety, and perceived threat account for 41.8% of the variance of positive cognitive processing, and these variables along with positive cognitive processing accounted for 42.7% of the variance of PTG. Positive cognitive processing mediated the pathways between perceived physical threat and PTG. Cognitive processing appears to play a key role in the emergence of PTG following cancer. By exploring survivors' cognitions and perceived threat, psychosocial providers may help cancer survivors cultivate PTG.

BACKGROUND: Exercise interventions improve fitness, functional capacity, and quality of life in patients with early-stage breast cancer, but to the authors' knowledge there are few data regarding the feasibility or potential benefits of exercise in women with metastatic breast cancer. METHODS: Individuals with metastatic breast cancer were randomized 1:1 to a 16-week moderate-intensity exercise intervention or wait-list control group. Intervention goals included 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week. The baseline and 16-week evaluations included a modified Bruce Ramp treadmill test, 7-day Physical Activity Recall interview, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ C-30) questionnaire. RESULTS: A total of 101 participants were randomized (48 to the intervention group and 53 to the control group). The median age of the participants was 49 years, the median time since the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer was 1.1 years, and approximately 42% of participants were undergoing chemotherapy at the time of enrollment. Study attrition was higher in the intervention arm (14 participants vs 8 participants; P = .15). Women randomized to the exercise intervention experienced a nonsignificant increase with regard to minutes of weekly exercise (62.4 minutes vs 46.0 minutes; P = .17) and physical functioning (EORTC QLQ C30: 4.79 vs 0.93 [P = .23] and Bruce Ramp Treadmill test: 0.61 minutes vs 0.37 minutes [P = .35]) compared with control participants. CONCLUSIONS: Participation in an exercise intervention did not appear to result in significant improvements in physical functioning in a heterogeneous group of women living with advanced breast cancer. Given the significant benefits of exercise in women with early-stage breast cancer, more work is needed to explore alternative interventions to determine whether exercise could help women with metastatic disease live more fully with fewer symptoms from disease and treatment.

BACKGROUND: American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) breast cancer survivors experience disparities in breast cancer incidence and age-adjusted mortality compared with non-Hispanic white (NHW) breast cancer survivors. In addition, mortality-to-incidence rates indicate that AI/ANs continue to have the poorest survival from breast cancer compared with other racial groups. "Native American Cancer Education for Survivors" (NACES) is a cultural education and support intervention for AI/AN patients with cancer that collects data from voluntary participants through the NACES quality-of-life (QOL) survey regarding their cancer experience and survivor journey. METHODS: Data from the NACES QOL survey were analyzed to determine whether barriers accessing and during initial cancer treatment impacted QOL domains for AI/AN cancer survivors. Exploratory analyses of selected variables were conducted and were followed by Kruskal-Wallis tests to determine whether these barriers influenced survivorship QOL for AI/AN breast cancer survivors. RESULTS: AI/AN breast cancer survivors' social QOL was significantly affected by barriers to accessing cancer treatment. Many respondents experienced barriers, including a lack of cancer care at local clinics and the distance traveled to receive cancer care. During treatment, too much paperwork and having to wait too long in the clinic for cancer care were the most frequently reported barriers. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment barriers influence AI/AN breast cancer survivors' social QOL. Mediating these barriers is crucial to ameliorating AI/AN survivors' disparities when accessing and completing cancer treatment and improving survivorship QOL. Cancer 2017;123:861-68.

BACKGROUND: Studies of related individuals have consistently demonstrated notable familial aggregation of cancer. We aim to estimate the heritability and genetic correlation attributable to the additive effects of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for cancer at 13 anatomical sites. METHODS: Between 2007 and 2014, the US National Cancer Institute has generated data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for 49 492 cancer case patients and 34 131 control patients. We apply novel mixed model methodology (GCTA) to this GWAS data to estimate the heritability of individual cancers, as well as the proportion of heritability attributable to cigarette smoking in smoking-related cancers, and the genetic correlation between pairs of cancers. RESULTS: GWAS heritability was statistically significant at nearly all sites, with the estimates of array-based heritability, hl (2), on the liability threshold (LT) scale ranging from 0.05 to 0.38. Estimating the combined heritability of multiple smoking characteristics, we calculate that at least 24% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 14% to 37%) and 7% (95% CI = 4% to 11%) of the heritability for lung and bladder cancer, respectively, can be attributed to genetic determinants of smoking. Most pairs of cancers studied did not show evidence of strong genetic correlation. We found only four pairs of cancers with marginally statistically significant correlations, specifically kidney and testes (rho = 0.73, SE = 0.28), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and pediatric osteosarcoma (rho = 0.53, SE = 0.21), DLBCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (rho = 0.51, SE =0.18), and bladder and lung (rho = 0.35, SE = 0.14). Correlation analysis also indicates that the genetic architecture of lung cancer differs between a smoking population of European ancestry and a nonsmoking Asian population, allowing for the possibility that the genetic etiology for the same disease can vary by population and environmental exposures. CONCLUSION: Our results provide important insights into the genetic architecture of cancers and suggest new avenues for investigation.

BACKGROUND: A rigorous assessment of the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) among prostate cancer (PC) survivors that controls for important confounding factors and competing risks is necessary to determine the risk of CRC in this population and to inform screening guidelines. METHODS: With data from Manitoba, Canada, subjects diagnosed with PC as their first cancer between 1987 and 2009 were age-matched with up to 5 men with no history of invasive cancer on the PC diagnosis date. Subjects were followed to the date of diagnosis of CRC or another cancer, death, emigration, or the study endpoint (December 31, 2009). Competing risk proportional hazards models were used to compare the CRC incidence between those with PC and those without PC with the following model covariates: history of lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, frequency of health care visits, diabetes, and socioeconomic status. Mutually exclusive competing outcomes included CRC, another primary cancer, and death. RESULTS: For a total of 559,081 person-years, 14,164 men with PC and 69,051 men without PC were followed. Men diagnosed with PC had an increased risk of a subsequent diagnosis of CRC (all CRC: hazard ratio [HR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.27; rectal cancer: HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.09-1.71). The treatment of PC with radiation was associated with an increased risk for rectal cancer (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.42-2.99) in comparison with PC cases not treated with radiation. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of CRC is increased after a diagnosis of PC and is highest for rectal cancer among those treated with radiation. CRC screening should be considered soon after the diagnosis of PC, especially for men planning for radiotherapy.

BACKGROUND: One reason for the low cancer screening rate in Japan is that people are not concerned about cancer if they do not have symptoms. METHODS: The authors retrospectively analyzed 18,405 cancer patients using hospital-based cancer registry data collected between 2007 and 2013 at the 13 hospitals of Shimane Prefecture, Japan. The symptomatic rates of five cancers (stomach, colorectal, lung, breast, and cervix) at each stage and the time of early diagnosis were investigated. The early detection rates of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals were investigated. RESULTS: The percentages of symptomatic cases tended to increase with progressive stages. The odds ratio (OR) of stage IV compared with that of stage I was 12.23 for stomach, 7.21 for colorectal, 16.91 for lung, 10.30 for breast, and 51.62 for cervical cancer. The proportions of early symptomatic cases at the time of diagnosis were low. Compared with the percentage of early symptomatic cases of stomach cancer of 25.5%, the percentage of lung cancer was the lowest, at 8.2% (OR 0.26), and the percentage of breast cancer was the highest, at 30.2% (OR 1.26). The percentages of early symptomatic cases of colorectal and cervical cancer were 18.9% (OR 0.68) and 19.9% (OR 0.73), respectively. The early detection rates of the asymptomatic and symptomatic groups were 77.6 and 36.1%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cancer registry data indicate that early cancers are asymptomatic, and once symptoms appear, treatment may not be effective. Policy makers should inform people of the necessity of cancer screening before they have symptoms.

BACKGROUND: The gastric cancer incidence rate differs widely across geographical areas. In Italy, in the province of Cremona the incidence is high, compared to the national situation. For this reason a specialized population-based registry was set up. METHODS: The collection encompasses all gastric cancers diagnosed in the three districts of the province since January 1, 2010. The main data sources were the pathological and Hospital Discharge Records and patient clinical charts. Only diagnoses of primary gastric cancer were considered. For each case the following variables were registered: personal data, medical history and symptoms at diagnosis; imaging assessments performed, details on surgery and other treatments received; genetic background and biomolecular characteristics; social and environmental factors. RESULTS: As of November 2017, 1087 cases were collected; of which 876, diagnosed up to December 2015, were analyzed. Male/female ratio was 1.4. The European Age-standardized Incidence Rate was 41.4 for males and 28.3 for females as compared to a national average of 33.3 and 17.0 respectively. Median age at diagnosis was 73 for male and 78 for female. Helicobacter Pylori infection was present in fewer than 20% of cases. HER-2 gene was amplified in about 25% of cases. Primary tumour location was the gastro-esophageal junction or cardia in 17.5% in males and 8.3% in females. The majority of cases (58.3%) were diagnosed at an advanced stage and overall only 41.2% underwent surgery. Median overall survival was 14.8 months for men and 18.5 for women. Age standardized 5-year relative survival was 31.4% for men and 40.5% for females. Neoadjuvant treatment was performed in fewer than 10% of patients who underwent surgery, and the rate of postoperative therapy adherence was low. DISCUSSION: This study shows a high gastric cancer incidence in the province of Cremona, with a geographical spread across different districts. Moreover, a high percentage of gastric cancers were detected at an advanced stage of disease and a low rate of 5-year relative survival was registered. Based on these findings, effective preventive interventional health strategies and screening procedures need to be implemented to reduce the impact of this pathology in this geographical area.

BACKGROUND: Early identification of mutations may guide patients with metastatic colorectal cancer toward targeted therapies that may be life prolonging. The authors assessed tumor genotype correlations with clinical characteristics to determine whether mutational profiling can account for clinical similarities, differences, and outcomes. METHODS: Under Institutional Review Board approval, 222 patients with metastatic colon adenocarcinoma (n = 158) and rectal adenocarcinoma (n = 64) who underwent clinical tumor genotyping were reviewed. Multiplexed tumor genotyping screened for >150 mutations across 15 commonly mutated cancer genes. The chi-square test was used to assess genotype frequency by tumor site and additional clinical characteristics. Cox multivariate analysis was used to assess the impact of genotype on overall survival. RESULTS: Broad-based tumor genotyping revealed clinical and anatomic differences that could be linked to gene mutations. NRAS mutations were associated with rectal cancer versus colon cancer (12.5% vs 0.6%; P < .001) and with age >/=56 years (7% vs 0.9%; P = .02). Conversely, v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) mutations were associated with colon cancer (13% vs 3%; P = .024) and older age (15.8% vs 4.6%; P = .006). TP53 mutations were associated with rectal cancer (30% vs 18%; P = .048), younger age (14% vs 28.7%; P = .007), and men (26.4% vs 14%; P = .03). Lung metastases were associated with PIK3CA mutations (23% vs 8.7%; P = .004). Only mutations in BRAF were independently associated with decreased overall survival (hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-5.27; P = .029). CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that underlying molecular profiles can differ between colon and rectal cancers. Further investigation is warranted to assess whether the differences identified are important in determining the optimal treatment course for these patients.

Breast and cervical cancer have had disparate impact on the lives of women. The burden of breast and cervical cancer is more prominent among some racial and ethnic minority women. Providing comprehensive care to all medically underserved women is a critical element in continuing the battle to reduce cancer burden and eliminate disparities. The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program is the only nationally organized cancer screening program for underserved women in the United States. Its public health goal is to ensure access to high-quality screening, follow-up, and treatment services for diverse and vulnerable populations that, in turn, may reduce disparities.

CONTEXT: Substantial innovation related to cancer prevention and treatment has occurred in recent decades. However, these innovations have often come at a significant cost. Cost-utility analysis provides a useful framework to assess if the benefits from innovation are worth the additional cost. This systematic review on published cost-utility analyses related to cancer care is from 1988 through 2013. Analyses were conducted in 2013-2015. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: This review analyzed data from the Tufts Medical Center Cost-Effectiveness Analysis Registry (www.cearegistry.org), a comprehensive registry with detailed information on 4,339 original cost-utility analyses published in the peer-reviewed medical and economic literature through 2013. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: There were 721 cancer-related cost-utility analyses published from 1998 through 2013, with roughly 12% of studies focused on primary prevention and 17% focused on secondary prevention. The most often studied cancers were breast cancer (29%); colorectal cancer (11%); and prostate cancer (8%). The median reported incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (in 2014 U.S. dollars) were $25,000 for breast cancer, $24,000 for colorectal cancer, and $34,000 for prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The current evidence indicates that there are many interventions that are cost effective across cancer sites and levels of prevention. However, the results highlight the relatively small number of cancer cost-utility analyses devoted to primary prevention compared with secondary or tertiary prevention.

The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP) has played a critical role in providing cancer screening services to American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/ANs) women and strengthening tribal screening capacity. Since 1991, the NBCCEDP has funded states, tribal nations, and tribal organizations to develop and implement organized screening programs. The ultimate goal is to deliver breast and cervical cancer screening to women who do not have health insurance and cannot afford to pay for these services. The delivery of clinical services is supported through complementary program efforts such as professional development, public education and outreach, and patient navigation. This article seeks to describe the growth of NBCCEDP's tribal commitment and the unique history and aspects of serving the AI/AN population. The article describes: 1) how this program has demonstrated success in improving screening of AI/AN women; 2) innovative partnerships with the Indian Health Service, state programs, and other organizations that have improved tribal public health infrastructure; and 3) the evolution of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention work with tribal communities.

In order to update the previous version of the European Code against Cancer and formulate evidence-based recommendations, a systematic search of the literature was performed according to the methodology agreed by the Code Working Groups. Based on the review, the 4th edition of the European Code against Cancer recommends: "Take part in organized cancer screening programmes for: Bowel cancer (men and women); Breast cancer (women); Cervical cancer (women)." Organized screening programs are preferable because they provide better conditions to ensure that the Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Screening are followed in order to achieve the greatest benefit with the least harm. Screening is recommended only for those cancers where a demonstrated life-saving effect substantially outweighs the potential harm of examining very large numbers of people who may otherwise never have, or suffer from, these cancers, and when an adequate quality of the screening is achieved. EU citizens are recommended to participate in cancer screening each time an invitation from the national or regional screening program is received and after having read the information materials provided and carefully considered the potential benefits and harms of screening. Screening programs in the European Union vary with respect to the age groups invited and to the interval between invitations, depending on each country's cancer burden, local resources, and the type of screening test used For colorectal cancer, most programs in the EU invite men and women starting at the age of 50-60 years, and from then on every 2 years if the screening test is the guaiac-based fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test, or every 10 years or more if the screening test is flexible sigmoidoscopy or total colonoscopy. Most programs continue sending invitations to screening up to the age of 70-75 years. For breast cancer, most programs in the EU invite women starting at the age of 50 years, and not before the age of 40 years, and from then on every 2 years until the age of 70-75 years. For cervical cancer, if cytology (Pap) testing is used for screening, most programs in the EU invite women starting at the age of 25-30 years and from then on every 3 or 5 years. If human papillomavirus testing is used for screening, most women are invited starting at the age of 35 years (usually not before age 30 years) and from then on every 5 years or more. Irrespective of the test used, women continue participating in screening until the age of 60 or 65 years, and continue beyond this age unless the most recent test results are normal.

BACKGROUND: The Childhood Cancer Research Network (CCRN) was established within the Children's Oncology Group (COG) in July 2008 to provide a centralized pediatric cancer research registry for investigators conducting approved etiologic and survivorship studies. The authors conducted an ecological analysis to characterize CCRN catchment at >200 COG institutions by demographic characteristics, diagnosis, and geographic location to determine whether the CCRN can serve as a population-based registry for childhood cancer. METHODS: During 2009 to 2011, 18,580 US children newly diagnosed with cancer were registered in the CCRN. These observed cases were compared with age-specific, sex-specific, and race/ethnicity-specific expected numbers calculated from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program cancer incidence rates and 2010 US Census data. RESULTS: Overall, 42% of children (18,580 observed/44,267 expected) who were diagnosed with cancer at age <20 years were registered in the CCRN, including 45%, 57%, 51%, 44%, and 24% of those diagnosed at birth, ages 1 to 4 years, ages 5 to 9 years, ages 10 to 14 years, and ages 15 to 19 years, respectively. Some malignancies were better represented in the CCRN (leukemia, 59%; renal tumors, 67%) than others (retinoblastoma, 34%). There was little evidence of differences by sex or race/ethnicity, although rates in nonwhites were somewhat lower than rates in whites. CONCLUSIONS: Given the low observed-to-expected ratio, it will be important to identify challenges and barriers to registration to improve case ascertainment, especially for rarer diagnoses and older age groups; however, it is encouraging that some diagnoses in younger children are fairly representative of the population. Overall, the CCRN is providing centralized, real-time access to cases for research and could be used as a model for other national cooperative groups.

Base excision repair (BER) repairs mutagenic or genotoxic DNA base lesions, thought to be important for both the etiology and treatment of cancer. Cancer phenotypic stress induces oxidative lesions, and deamination products are responsible for one of the most prevalent mutational signatures in cancer. Chemotherapeutic agents induce genotoxic DNA base damage that are substrates for BER, while synthetic lethal approaches targeting BER-related factors are making their way into the clinic. Thus, there are three strategies by which BER is envisioned to be relevant in cancer chemotherapy: (i) to maintain cellular growth in the presence of endogenous DNA damage in stressed cancer cells, (ii) to maintain viability after exogenous DNA damage is introduced by therapeutic intervention, or (iii) to confer synthetic lethality in cancer cells that have lost one or more additional DNA repair pathways. Here, we discuss the potential treatment strategies, and briefly summarize the progress that has been made in developing inhibitors to core BER-proteins and related factors.

BACKGROUND: Investigations of long-term cancer survivors (LTCS) indicate that this population is not appreciably different from cancer-naive peers with respect to several neuropsychiatric domains. The current study sought to determine whether differences in psychiatric medication use might help to explain the negative findings. METHODS: In a nationally representative sample, 5692 subjects were queried for cancer history, psychiatric diagnoses, and psychotropic medication use. The LTCS were defined as those individuals who were >/=5 years from diagnosis and whose cancer was in remission or cured. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were obtained from multivariable logistic regression models evaluating the relationship between cancer status and use of psychiatric medications. The interaction between case/control status and psychiatric diagnoses was also tested in a logistic regression model to predict psychotropic medication use. RESULTS: A total of 225 participants met the criteria for LTCS and 3953 met the criteria for cancer-naive controls (CNC). The LTCS were no more likely than CNC to carry a psychiatric diagnosis. Despite the LTCS reporting somewhat greater psychotropic medication use compared with the CNC (28.8% vs 22.3%), unadjusted and adjusted differences did not reach statistical significance, possibly due to sample size. The interaction between case/control status and carrying a psychiatric diagnosis was not found to be significantly associated with receiving a psychiatric medication. CONCLUSIONS: LTCS and CNC demonstrated comparable rates of psychiatric prescription medication use. The relationship between taking a psychiatric medication and carrying a psychiatric diagnosis was not found to be significantly different between the case and control groups. These findings contribute to an emerging hypothesis that in general LTCS are not a particularly psychiatrically vulnerable group.

OBJECTIVES: Disruption in the stability of respiratory microbiota is known to be associated with many chronic respiratory diseases. However, only few studies have examined microbiomes in lung cancer. Therefore, we characterized and compared the microbiomes of patients with lung cancer and those with benign mass-like lesions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bronchoalveolar fluid was collected prospectively to evaluate lung masses in patients who had undergone bronchoscopies from May to September 2015. Twenty-eight patients (20 male, 8 female) were enrolled: 20 diagnosed with lung cancer and 8 diagnosed with benign diseases. Samples were analysed by 16S rRNA-based next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: The participants' mean age was 64+/-11years. Bacterial operational taxonomic units were classified into 26 phyla, 44 classes, 81 orders, 153 families, 288 genera, and 797 species. The relative abundance of two phyla (Firmicutes and TM7) was significantly increased in patients with lung cancer (p=0.037 and 0.035, respectively). Furthermore, two genera (Veillonella and Megasphaera) were relatively more abundant in lung cancer patients (p=0.003 and 0.022, respectively). The area under the curve of a combination of these two genera used to predict lung cancer was 0.888 (sensitivity=95.0%, specificity=75.0% and sensitivity=70.0%, specificity=100.0%; p=0.002). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that differences exist in the bacterial communities of patients with lung cancer and those with benign mass-like lesions. The genera Veillonella and Megasphaera showed the potential to serve as biomarkers to predict lung cancer. Thus, the lung microbiota may change the environment in patients with lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Although not guideline recommended, studies suggest 50% of locoregional breast cancer patients undergo systemic imaging during follow-up, prompting its inclusion as a Choosing Wisely measure of potential overuse. Most studies rely on administrative data that cannot delineate scan intent (prompted by signs/symptoms vs. asymptomatic surveillance). This is a critical gap as intent is the only way to distinguish overuse from appropriate care. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess surveillance systemic imaging post-breast cancer treatment in a national sample accounting for scan intent. METHODS: A stage-stratified random sample of 10 women with stage II-III breast cancer in 2006-2007 was selected from each of 1217 Commission on Cancer-accredited facilities, for a total of 10,838 patients. Registrars abstracted scan type (computed tomography [CT], non-breast magnetic resonance imaging, bone scan, positron emission tomography/CT) and intent (cancer-related vs. not, asymptomatic surveillance vs. not) from medical records for 5 years post-diagnosis. Data were merged with each patient's corresponding National Cancer Database record, containing sociodemographic and tumor/treatment information. RESULTS: Of 10,838 women, 30% had one or more, and 12% had two or more, systemic surveillance scans during a 4-year follow-up period. Patients were more likely to receive surveillance imaging in the first follow-up year (lower proportions during subsequent years) and if they had estrogen receptor/progesterone receptor-negative tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Locoregional breast cancer patients undergo asymptomatic systemic imaging during follow-up despite guidelines recommending against it, but at lower rates than previously reported. Providers appear to use factors that confer increased recurrence risk to tailor decisions about systemic surveillance imaging, perhaps reflecting limitations of data on which current guidelines are based.

Japanese mortality due to colorectal cancer is on the rise, surpassing 49,000 in 2015. Many new treatment methods have been developed during recent decades. The Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum Guidelines 2016 for the treatment of colorectal cancer (JSCCR Guidelines 2016) were prepared to show standard treatment strategies for colorectal cancer, to eliminate disparities among institutions in terms of treatment, to eliminate unnecessary treatment and insufficient treatment, and to deepen mutual understanding between health-care professionals and patients by making these Guidelines available to the general public. These Guidelines were prepared by consensus reached by the JSCCR Guideline Committee, based on a careful review of the evidence retrieved by literature searches, and in view of the medical health insurance system and actual clinical practice settings in Japan. Therefore, these Guidelines can be used as a tool for treating colorectal cancer in actual clinical practice settings. More specifically, they can be used as a guide to obtaining informed consent from patients and choosing the method of treatment for each patient. As a result of the discussions held by the Guideline Committee, controversial issues were selected as Clinical Questions, and recommendations were made. Each recommendation is accompanied by a classification of the evidence and a classification of recommendation categories based on the consensus reached by the Guideline Committee members. Here we present the English version of the JSCCR Guidelines 2016.

BACKGROUND: Sexual dysfunction is a distressing long-term effect after gynecological cancer and affects the majority of survivors for years after the completion of therapy. Despite its prevalence, treatment-related sexual dysfunction is underrecognized and undertreated for survivors. Thus, the aim of this study was to develop and test a brief psychoeducational intervention for managing sexual dysfunction for women who have undergone treatment for ovarian cancer (OC). METHODS: Forty-six OC survivors with documented, treatment-related sexual dysfunction received a single half-day group intervention that included sexual health education and rehabilitation training, relaxation and cognitive behavioral therapy skills to address sexual symptoms, and a single tailored booster telephone call 4 weeks after the group. Assessment measures were completed at the baseline (baseline 1), after an 8-week no-treatment run-in period (baseline 2), and then again 2 and 6 months after the intervention. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) was used to assess sexual functioning, and the Brief Symptom Inventory 18 (BSI-18) was used to capture psychological distress. RESULTS: Between baseline 1 and baseline 2, there were no significant changes in the study measures, and this indicated no natural improvement during the run-in period. In contrast, the total FSFI scores improved significantly from baseline 1 to the 2- (n = 45; P < .0005) and 6-month time points (n = 42; P < .05). The BSI-18 scores were also significantly improved at the 2- (P < .005) and 6-month time points (P < .01) in comparison with baseline 1. CONCLUSIONS: This brief behavioral intervention led to significant improvements in overall sexual functioning and psychological distress that were maintained at the 6-month follow-up. The results demonstrate the feasibility of this brief, low-intensity behavioral intervention and support the development of a larger randomized controlled trial. Cancer 2018;124:176-82.

BACKGROUND: Financial problems caused by cancer and its treatment can substantially affect survivors and their families and create barriers to seeking health care. METHODS: The authors identified cancer survivors diagnosed as adults (n=1556) from the nationally representative 2010 National Health Interview Survey. Using multivariable logistic regression analyses, the authors report sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment-related factors associated with perceived cancer-related financial problems and the association between financial problems and forgoing or delaying health care because of cost. Adjusted percentages using the predictive marginals method are presented. RESULTS: Cancer-related financial problems were reported by 31.8% (95% confidence interval, 29.3%-34.5%) of survivors. Factors found to be significantly associated with cancer-related financial problems in survivors included younger age at diagnosis, minority race/ethnicity, history of chemotherapy or radiation treatment, recurrence or multiple cancers, and shorter time from diagnosis. After adjustment for covariates, respondents who reported financial problems were more likely to report delaying (18.3% vs 7.4%) or forgoing overall medical care (13.8% vs 5.0%), prescription medications (14.2% vs 7.6%), dental care (19.8% vs 8.3%), eyeglasses (13.9% vs 5.8%), and mental health care (3.9% vs 1.6%) than their counterparts without financial problems (all P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Cancer-related financial problems are not only disproportionately represented in survivors who are younger, members of a minority group, and have a higher treatment burden, but may also contribute to survivors forgoing or delaying medical care after cancer.

Proposals to improve implementation, monitoring and evaluation of breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening programmes have been developed in a European project involving scientists and professionals experienced in cancer registration (EUROCOURSE). They call for a clear and more active role for cancer registries through better interfaces with cancer screening programmes and adapting data contents of cancer registries for evaluation purposes. Cancer registries are recognised as essential for adequate evaluation of cancer screening programmes, but they are not involved in screening evaluation in several European countries. This is a key barrier to improving the effectiveness of programmes across Europe. The variation in Europe in the implementation of cancer screening offers a unique opportunity to learn from best practices in collaboration between cancer registries and screening programmes. Population-based cancer registries have experience and tools in collecting and analysing relevant data, e.g. for diagnostic and therapeutic determinants of mortality. In order to accelerate improvements in cancer control we argue that cancer registries should take co-responsibility in promoting effective screening evaluation in Europe. Additional investments are vital to further development of infrastructures and activities for screening evaluation and monitoring in the national settings and also at the pan-European level. The EUROCOURSE project also aimed to harmonise implementation of the European quality assurance guidelines for cancer screening programmes across Europe through standardising routine data collection and analysis, and definitions for key performance indicators for screening registers. Data linkage between cancer and screening registers and other repositories of demographic data and cause of death and where available clinical registers is key to implementing the European screening standards and thereby reducing the burden of disease through early detection. Greater engagement of cancer registries in this collaborative effort is also essential to develop adequate evaluation of innovations in cancer prevention and care.

BACKGROUND: Two large-scale prostate cancer screening trials using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) have given conflicting results in terms of the efficacy of such screening. One of those trials, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, previously reported outcomes with 13 years of follow-up. This study presents updated findings from the PLCO trial. METHODS: The PLCO trial randomized subjects from 1993 to 2001 to an intervention or control arm. Intervention-arm men received annual PSA tests for 6 years and digital rectal examinations for 4 years. This study used a linkage with the National Death Index to extend mortality follow-up to a maximum of 19 years after randomization. RESULTS: Men were randomized to the intervention arm (n = 38,340) or the control arm (n = 38,343). The median follow-up time was 14.8 years (25th/75th, 12.7/16.5 years) in the intervention arm and 14.7 years (25th/75th, 12.6/16.4 years) in the control arm. There were 255 deaths from prostate cancer in the intervention arm and 244 deaths from prostate cancer in the control arm; this meant a rate ratio (RR) of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87-1.24). The RR for all-cause mortality was 0.977 (95% CI, 0.950-1.004). It was estimated that 86% of the men in the control arm and 99% of the men in the intervention arm received any PSA testing during the trial, and the estimated yearly screening-phase PSA testing rates were 46% and 84%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Extended follow-up of the PLCO trial over a median of 15 years continues to indicate no reduction in prostate cancer mortality for the intervention arm versus the control arm. Because of the high rate of control-arm PSA testing, this finding can be viewed as showing no benefit of organized screening versus opportunistic screening. Cancer 2017;123:592-599.

BACKGROUND: Latinas have the highest rates of cervical cancer in the United States and the second highest rate of cervical cancer mortality. One factor in the disparity is the relatively low rate of screening for cervical cancer in this population. METHODS: Eligible women who were out of adherence with cervical cancer screening (>3 years since their last Papanicolaou [Pap] test) were identified via medical record review by a federally qualified local health center. The effects of a low-intensity intervention (video delivered to participants' homes; n = 150) and a high-intensity intervention (video plus a home-based educational session; n = 146) on cervical cancer screening uptake in comparison with a control arm (usual care; n = 147) were investigated. A cost-effectiveness analysis of the interventions was conducted: all intervention costs were calculated, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was computed. Finally, women with positive Pap tests were provided navigation by a community health educator to ensure that they received follow-up care. RESULTS: A total of 443 Latinas participated. Seven months after randomization, significantly more women in the high-intensity arm received a Pap test (53.4%) in comparison with the low-intensity arm (38.7%; P < .001) and the usual-care arm (34.0%; P < .01). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for high-intensity women versus the control group amounted to $4.24. Twelve women had positive Pap tests, which encompassed diagnoses ranging from atypical squamous cells of unknown significance to invasive cancer; these women received navigation for follow-up care. CONCLUSIONS: A culturally appropriate, in-home, promotora-led educational intervention was successful in increasing cervical cancer screening among Latinas. Cancer 2017;123:666-674.

BACKGROUND: The American Cancer Society (ACS) recommends men have the opportunity to make an informed decision about screening for prostate cancer (PCa). The ACS developed a unique decision aid (ACS-DA) for this purpose. However, to date, studies evaluating the efficacy of the ACS-DA are lacking. The authors evaluated the ACS-DA among a cohort of medically underserved men (MUM). METHODS: A multiethnic cohort of MUM (n = 285) was prospectively included between June 2010 and December 2014. The ACS-DA was presented in a group format. Levels of knowledge on PCa were evaluated before and after the presentation. Participants' decisional conflict and thoughts about the presentation also were evaluated. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine factors associated with having an adequate level of knowledge. RESULTS: Before receiving the ACS-DA, 33.1% of participants had adequate knowledge on PCa, and this increased to 77% after the DA (P < .0001). On multivariate analysis, higher education level (odds ratio, 11.19; P = .001) and history of another cancer (odds ratio, 7.45; P = .03) were associated with having adequate knowledge after receiving the DA. Levels of decisional conflict were low and were correlated with levels of knowledge after receiving the DA. The majority of men also rated the presentation as favorable and would recommend the ACS-DA to others. CONCLUSIONS: Use of the ACS-DA was feasible among MUM and led to increased PCa knowledge. This also correlated with low levels of decisional conflict. The ACS-DA presented to groups of men may serve as a feasible tool for informed decision making in a MUM population.

Visions for the future are a normal developmental process for adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with and without cancer, and these visions often include expectations of sexual and romantic relationships. AYA cancer survivors indicate reproductive health is an issue of great importance and more attention is needed in the health care setting throughout the cancer experience, beginning at diagnosis. Various practice guidelines are predominately focused on fertility; are intended to influence survivorship care plans; and do not encompass the broad scope of reproductive health that includes romantic partnering, friendships, body image, sexuality, sexual identity, fertility, contraception, and more. Although interventions to reduce reproductive health-related sequelae from treatment are best approached as an evolving process, practitioners are not certain of the priorities of these various reproductive health content areas. Strategies incongruent with the reproductive health priorities of AYAs will likely thwart adequate follow-up care and foster feelings of isolation from the treatment team. Research is needed to identify these priorities and ensure discussions of diverse content areas. This review explored various domains of reproductive health and emphasized how understanding the priorities of the AYA cancer cohort will guide future models of care.

OBJECTIVE: To examine incidences and risk factors for metachronous vulvar, vaginal, and anal malignancies after a cervical cancer diagnosis. METHODS: This is a retrospective study examining data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Result Program between 1973 and 2013. Cumulative incidences of vulvar, vaginal, and anal cancers after the diagnosis of cervical cancer were assessed (n=79,050). Multivariable analysis was performed to determine independent risk factors for these metachronous cancers. RESULTS: Vaginal cancer (20-year cumulative incidence, 0.57%) was the most common type of metachronous malignancy, followed by vulvar cancer (0.33%), and anal cancer (0.16%, P<0.001). Median time to diagnosis was 5.4years for vaginal cancer, 6.5years for vulvar cancer, and 13.5years for anal cancer. On multivariable analysis, metachronous vulvar cancer was associated with older age (hazard ratio [HR] per year 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.05, P<0.001), squamous histology (HR 2.64, 95%CI 1.38-5.05, P=0.003), and radiotherapy use (HR 2.52, 95%CI 1.66-3.84, P<0.001); metachronous vaginal cancer was associated with older age (HR per year 1.03, 95%CI 1.02-1.04, P<0.001) and Black race (HR 1.73, 95%CI 1.20-2.48, P=0.003); and metachronous anal cancer was associated with older age (HR 1.03, 95%CI 1.01-1.05, P=0.017). Overall survival of metachronous cancer was poor (5-year rates: 46.3% for vulvar, 43.0% for vaginal, and 47.5% for anal cancer, respectively). CONCLUSION: Although rare, the rate of ano-genital cancers continues to increase over time after a cervical cancer diagnosis. Long-term follow-up and surveillance after cervical cancer treatment is therefore reasonable to detect these metachronous malignancies, particularly in those with risk factors.

Cancer immunotherapy has shown impressive clinical results in the last decade, improving both solid and hematologic cancer patients' overall survival. Nevertheless, most of the molecular aspects underlying the response to this approach are still under investigation. miRNAs in particular have been described as regulators of a plethora of different immunologic processes and thus have the potential to be key in the future developments of immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize and discuss the emerging role of miRNAs in the diagnosis and therapeutics of the four principal cancer immunotherapy approaches: immune checkpoint blockade, adoptive cell therapy, cancer vaccines, and cytokine therapy. In particular, this review is focused on potential roles for miRNAs to be adjuvants in soluble factor- and cell-based therapies, with the aim of helping to increase specificity and decrease toxicity, and on the potential for rationally identified miRNA-based diagnostic approaches to aid in precision clinical immunooncology.

PURPOSE: To review the reports of subsequent neoplasms (SNs) in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) cohort that were made through January 1, 2006, and published before July 31, 2008, and to discuss the host-, disease-, and therapy-related risk factors associated with SNs. PATIENTS AND METHODS: SNs were ascertained by survivor self-reports and subsequently confirmed by pathology findings or medical record review. Cumulative incidence of SNs and standardized incidence ratios for second malignant neoplasms (SMNs) were calculated. The impact of host-, disease-, and therapy-related risk factors was evaluated by Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among 14,358 cohort members, 730 reported 802 SMNs (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers). This represents a 2.3-fold increase in the number of SMNs over that reported in the first comprehensive analysis of SMNs in the CCSS cohort, which was done 7 years ago. In addition, 66 cases of meningioma and 1,007 cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer were diagnosed. The 30-year cumulative incidence of SMNs was 9.3% and that of nonmelanoma skin cancer was 6.9%. Risk of SNs remains elevated for more than 20 years of follow-up for all primary childhood cancer diagnoses. In multivariate analyses, risks differ by SN subtype, but include radiotherapy, age at diagnosis, sex, family history of cancer, and primary childhood cancer diagnosis. Female survivors whose primary childhood cancer diagnosis was Hodgkin's lymphoma or sarcoma and who received radiotherapy are at particularly increased risk. Analyses of risk associated with radiotherapy demonstrated different dose-response curves for specific SNs. CONCLUSION: Childhood cancer survivors are at a substantial and increasing risk for SNs, including nonmelanoma skin cancer and meningiomas. Health care professionals should understand the magnitude of these risks to provide individuals with appropriate counseling and follow-up.

Breast cancer epidemic in the early twenty-first century results in around two million new cases and half-a-million of the disease-related deaths registered annually worldwide. A particularly dramatic situation is attributed to some specific patient subgroups such as the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). TNBC is a particularly aggressive type of breast cancer lacking clear diagnostic approach and targeted therapies. Consequently, more than 50% of the TNBC patients die of the metastatic BC within the first 6 months of the diagnosis. In the current study we have hypothesised that multi-omic approach utilising blood samples may lead to discovery of a unique molecular signature of the TNBC subtype. The results achieved demonstrate, indeed, multi-omics as highly promising approach that could be of great clinical utility for development of predictive diagnosis, targeted prevention and treatments tailored to the person-overall advancing the management of the TNBC.

AIM: To identify the relationship between HbA1c and cancers in people with or without diabetes. BACKGROUND: Cancer is a major public health problem, accounting for 8.2 million deaths worldwide in 2012. HbA1c level has been associated with the risk of developing certain cancers, although the existing evidence is conflicting. METHODS: EMBASE, MEDLINE, CINAHL and the Cochrane Library were searched. Eligible articles included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, case-control studies, systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Participants of either sex, with or without Type 1 or 2 diabetes, were included. The studies were assessed using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) criteria by two independent assessors. No meta-analysis was performed because of the heterogeneity of results. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies from 1006 met the inclusion criteria, of which 14 were cohort studies and five were nested case-control studies. Eight studies investigated outcomes for all cancer sites. Four of these studies reported that higher HbA1c levels were associated with higher incidence and/or mortality risk for all cancers. One study observed a U-shaped relationship between HbA1c and cancer incidence and mortality. Increasing HbA1c levels were associated with increasing risk of developing colorectal, pancreatic, respiratory and female genital tract cancers. No increased risk was observed for breast cancer, gastrointestinal or urological malignancies. CONCLUSION: HbA1c appears to be associated with cancer incidence and/or cancer mortality, but further studies are needed to fully understand the complex relationship between HbA1c and cancer.

OBJECTIVE: We aim to describe the economic burden of UK cancer survivorship for breast, colorectal and prostate cancer patients treated with curative intent, 1 year post-diagnosis. METHODS: Patient-level data were collected over a 3-month period 12-15 months post-diagnosis to estimate the monthly societal costs incurred by cancer survivors. Self-reported resource utilisation data were obtained via the electronic Patient-reported Outcomes from Cancer Survivors system and included community-based health and social care, medications, travel costs and informal care. Hospital costs were retrieved through data linkage. Multivariate regression analysis was used to examine cost predictors. RESULTS: Overall, 298 patients were included in the analysis, including 136 breast cancer, 83 colorectal cancer and 79 prostate cancer patients. The average monthly societal cost was $ US 409 (95%CI: $ US 316-$ US 502) [mean: pound 260, 95%CI: pound 198- pound 322] and was incurred by 92% of patients. This was divided into costs to the National Health Service (mean: $ US 279, 95%CI: $ US 207-$ US 351) [mean: pound 177, 95%CI: pound 131- pound 224], patients' out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses (mean: $ US 40, 95%CI: $ US 15-$ US 65) [mean: pound 25, 95%CI: pound 9- pound 42] and the cost of informal care (mean: $ US 110, 95%CI: $ US 57-$ US 162) [mean: pound 70, 95%CI: pound 38- pound 102]. The distribution of costs was skewed with a small number of patients incurring very high costs. Multivariate analyses showed higher societal costs for breast cancer patients. Significant predictors of OOP costs included age and socioeconomic deprivation. CONCLUSIONS: This study found the economic burden of cancer survivorship is unevenly distributed in the population and that cancer survivors may still incur substantial costs over 1 year post-diagnosis. In addition, this study illustrates the feasibility of using an innovative online data collection platform to collect patient-reported resource utilisation information.

BACKGROUND: Combined bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction is a common major surgical procedure in women with breast cancer and in those with a family history of breast cancer. As this large surgical procedure induces muscle protein loss, a preserved anabolic response to nutrition is warranted for optimal recovery. It is unclear whether the presence of early stage cancer negatively affects the protein metabolic response to major surgery as this would mandate perioperative nutritional support. METHODS: In nine women with early stage (Stage II) breast malignancy and nine healthy women with a genetic predisposition to breast cancer undergoing the same large surgical procedure, we examined whether surgery influences the catabolic response to overnight fasting and the anabolic response to nutrition differently. Prior to and within 24 h after combined bilateral mastectomy and reconstruction surgery, whole body protein synthesis and breakdown rates were assessed after overnight fasting and after meal intake by stable isotope methodology to enable the calculation of net protein catabolism in the post-absorptive state and net protein anabolic response to a meal. RESULTS: Major surgery resulted in an up-regulation of post-absorptive protein synthesis and breakdown rates (P < 0.001) and lower net protein catabolism (P < 0.05) and was associated with insulin resistance and increased systemic inflammation (P < 0.01). Net anabolic response to the meal was reduced after surgery (P < 0.05) but higher in cancer (P < 0.05) indicative of a more preserved meal efficiency. The significant relationship between net protein anabolism and the amount of amino acids available in the circulation (R(2) = 0.85, P < 0.001) was independent of the presence of non-cachectic early stage breast cancer or surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of early stage breast cancer does not enhance the normal catabolic response to major surgery or further attenuates the anabolic response to meal intake within 24 h after major surgery in patients with non-cachectic breast cancer. This indicates that the acute anabolic potential to conventional feeding is maintained in non-cachectic early stage breast cancer after major surgery.

BACKGROUND: Adenocarcinomas of the appendix represent a heterogeneous disease depending on the presence of mucinous histology, histologic grade, and stage. In the current study, the authors sought to explore the interplay of these factors with systemic chemotherapy in a large population data set. METHODS: Patients in the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) who were diagnosed with mucinous, nonmucinous, and signet ring cell-type appendiceal neoplasms from 1985 through 2006 were selected. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression models were developed. RESULTS: A total of 11,871 patients met the inclusion criteria for the current study: 50.3% had mucinous neoplasms, 40.5% had nonmucinous neoplasms, and 9.2% had signet ring cell-type neoplasms. The 5-year overall survival (OS) stratified by grade was similar among patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to stage III disease but not for those with stage IV disease. The median OS for patients with stage IV mucinous and nonmucinous tumors was 6.4 years and 2.3 years, respectively, for those with well differentiated histology (P<.0001) and was 1.5 years and 0.8 years, respectively, for those with poorly differentiated histology (P<.0001). In multivariable modeling for stage I to III disease, adjuvant chemotherapy improved OS for both mucinous and nonmucinous histologies, with hazard ratios (HRs) of 0.78 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.68-0.89 [P = .0002]) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.74-0.94 [P = .002]), respectively. For patients with stage IV disease, systemic chemotherapy significantly improved OS for those with nonmucinous (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.64-0.82 [P<.0001]) but not mucinous (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.86-1.04 [P = .2) histologies, although this was grade-dependent. The median OS for chemotherapy versus no chemotherapy was 6.4 years versus 6.5 years (P value not significant) for patients with mucinous, well-differentiated tumors and 1.6 years versus 1.0 years (P = .0007) for patients with mucinous, poorly differentiated tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrated a significant OS benefit regardless of histology. However, for patients with stage IV disease, the benefit of systemic chemotherapy varied by tumor histology and grade, with patients with well-differentiated, mucinous, appendiceal adenocarcinomas deriving no survival benefit from systemic chemotherapy.

Lycopene, a compound that blocks the action of free radicals and oxygen molecules, is found in tomatoes and tomato-based products and linked to a reduced incidence of cancer. Increasing willingness of patients to maintain a healthy lifestyle by supplemental intake of nutrients and acceptance of alternative therapeutics has boosted research into nutraceuticals. The potential of lycopene to prevent or treat cancer has been investigated, but outcomes are inconsistent and its mode of action is still unknown. Further studies are needed to understand the role of lycopene in cancer prevention and treatment. The impact of lycopene on viability, proliferation, migration, and invasion of five different cancer cell lines was determined using monolayer and spheroid cultures. Cell viability was significantly reduced upon lycopene treatment at physiologically attainable concentrations. Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion did not change upon lycopene treatment. Ovarian cancer spheroids initially showed a decreased proliferation and after 14 days increased cell viability upon lycopene treatment, confirming the potential of lycopene to reduce cancer cell growth in short-term cultures and also indicate enhanced cell viability over prolonged exposure. This study cannot substantiate that lycopene inhibits cell functions associated with tumor growth, even in a 3D cancer model that mimics the natural tumor microenvironment.

BACKGROUND: Body image is a critical psychosocial issue for patients with cancer because they often undergo significant changes to appearance and functioning. The primary purpose of this review article was to identify empirically-supported approaches to treat body image difficulties of adult cancer patients that can be incorporated into high-quality comprehensive cancer care. METHODS: An overview was provided of theoretical models of body image relevant to cancer patients, and findings were presented from published literature on body image and cancer from 2003 to 2013. These data were integrated with information from the patient-doctor communication literature to delineate a practical approach for assessing and treating body image concerns of adult cancer patients. RESULTS: Body image difficulties were found across patients with diverse cancer sites, and were most prevalent in the immediate postoperative and treatment period. Age, body mass index, and specific cancer treatments have been identified as potential risk factors for body image disturbance in cancer patients. Current evidence supports the use of time-limited cognitive behavioral therapy interventions for addressing these difficulties. Other intervention strategies also show promise but require further study. Potential indicators of body image difficulties were identified to alert health care professionals when to refer patients for psychosocial care, and a framework was proposed for approaching conversations about body image that can be used by the oncologic treatment team. CONCLUSIONS: Body image issues affect a wide array of cancer patients. Providers can use available evidence combined with information from the health care communication literature to develop practical strategies for treating body image concerns of patients with cancer.

Objective: This study aimed to describe the sex disparities on cancer incidence and mortality in Jiashan population. Methods: All data concerning incident and death cases of cancers were gathered from the database of Cancer Registry in Jiashan county. Data from the 2010 China census was used as the standard population. Sex-specific age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs), mortality rates (ASMRs) per 100 000 persons for all cancers and types of each cancer were calculated for the years of 1990 to 1999, 2000 to 2009, 2010 to 2014, and 1990 to 2014. In addition, the corresponding male-to-female incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and mortality rate ratios (MRRs) were also calculated. Results: The ASIR of all cancers was 226.13/10(5) for the whole period of 1990 to 2014, with 266.04/10(5) for males and 187.22/10(5) for females, respectively. The corresponding IRR was 1.42 (95%CI: 1.39-1.46), with significant difference noticed in the incidence rates between males and females (P<0.05). The ASMR of all cancers was 155.39/10(5), with 206.55/10(5) for males and 104.98/10(5) for females, respectively. The corresponding MRR was 1.97 (95% CI: 1.91-2.03), with significant difference between males and females (P<0.05). Among all the cancer types, only gallbladder cancer and thyroid cancer showed female predominance in both incidence and mortality, with male predominance in all the remaining cancers. Conclusion: Finding from our study suggested that a male predominance in both incidence and mortality for a majority of cancers in Jiashan population.

OBJECTIVES: To analyze overall and cause-specific mortality, especially from cancer, among cement production workers. INTRODUCTION: Results from some epidemiological studies suggested an increased risk of overall mortality and of stomach cancer associated with employment in the cement production, but the presence of a hazard and, if present, the magnitude of a risk have not been precisely quantified. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of data on mortality from all causes, cardiovascular or respiratory diseases, and cancer among cement workers. METHODS: The literature search in PubMed and Scopus up to February 2016 and with appropriate keywords on mortality among cement workers revealed 188 articles which were screened. A total of 117 articles were reviewed in full text and 12 articles, referring to 11 study populations, were found to be relevant and of sufficient quality for further analysis. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Eight cohort studies, one proportionate mortality study, and two case-control studies were identified. The summary RRs were 0.89 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.76-1.01] for all-cause mortality, 0.94 (95 %, CI 0.80-1.08) for cancer mortality, 1.07 (95 % CI 0.79-1.35) for lung cancer mortality, and 0.93 (95 % CI 0.70-1.17) for stomach cancer mortality, respectively. Significant heterogeneity in results was observed among studies. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis does not provide evidence of increased risk of overall mortality, as well as cancer, cardiovascular or respiratory mortality in relation to employment in cement production.

Smoking is one of the largest preventable risk factors for developing cancer, and continued smoking by cancer patients is associated with increased toxicity, recurrence, risk of second primary cancer, and mortality. Cigarette smoke (CS) contains thousands of chemicals, including many known carcinogens. The carcinogenic effects of CS are well established, but relatively little work has been done to evaluate the effects of CS on cancer cells. In this review of the literature, the authors demonstrate that CS induces a more malignant tumor phenotype by increasing proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis and by activating prosurvival cellular pathways. Significant work is needed to understand the biologic effect of CS on cancer biology, including the development of model systems and the identification of critical biologic mediators of CS-induced changes in cancer cell physiology.

For decades, proteases have been associated with cancer progression due to the ability of some members of this large group of enzymes to degrade tumor cell surroundings, thereby facilitating cancer invasion and dissemination. However, the generation of mouse models deficient in proteases has revealed the existence of a great variety of functions among proteolytic enzymes in cancer biology, including important tumor-suppressive roles. Therefore, in this chapter, we describe methods to chemically induce different types of cancer (lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, oral and esophageal carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma, skin cancer, and fibrosarcoma) in genetically modified mouse models to efficiently evaluate the specific pro- or antitumoral function of proteases in cancer.

OBJECTIVES: This collaborative study, based on data collected by the network of Italian Cancer Registries (AIRTUM), describes the burden of rare cancers in Italy. Estimated number of new rare cancer cases yearly diagnosed (incidence), proportion of patients alive after diagnosis (survival), and estimated number of people still alive after a new cancer diagnosis (prevalence) are provided for about 200 different cancer entities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data herein presented were provided by AIRTUM population- based cancer registries (CRs), covering nowadays 52% of the Italian population. This monograph uses the AIRTUM database (January 2015), which includes all malignant cancer cases diagnosed between 1976 and 2010. All cases are coded according to the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (ICD-O-3). Data underwent standard quality checks (described in the AIRTUM data management protocol) and were checked against rare-cancer specific quality indicators proposed and published by RARECARE and HAEMACARE (www.rarecarenet.eu; www.haemacare.eu). The definition and list of rare cancers proposed by the RARECAREnet "Information Network on Rare Cancers" project were adopted: rare cancers are entities (defined as a combination of topographical and morphological codes of the ICD-O-3) having an incidence rate of less than 6 per 100,000 per year in the European population. This monograph presents 198 rare cancers grouped in 14 major groups. Crude incidence rates were estimated as the number of all new cancers occurring in 2000-2010 divided by the overall population at risk, for males and females (also for gender-specific tumours).The proportion of rare cancers out of the total cancers (rare and common) by site was also calculated. Incidence rates by sex and age are reported. The expected number of new cases in 2015 in Italy was estimated assuming the incidence in Italy to be the same as in the AIRTUM area. One- and 5-year relative survival estimates of cases aged 0-99 years diagnosed between 2000 and 2008 in the AIRTUM database, and followed up to 31 December 2009, were calculated using complete cohort survival analysis. To estimate the observed prevalence in Italy, incidence and follow-up data from 11 CRs for the period 1992-2006 were used, with a prevalence index date of 1 January 2007. Observed prevalence in the general population was disentangled by time prior to the reference date (</=2 years, 2-5 years, </=15 years). To calculate the complete prevalence proportion at 1 January 2007 in Italy, the 15-year observed prevalence was corrected by the completeness index, in order to account for those cancer survivors diagnosed before the cancer registry activity started. The completeness index by cancer and age was obtained by means of statistical regression models, using incidence and survival data available in the European RARECAREnet data. RESULTS: In total, 339,403 tumours were included in the incidence analysis. The annual incidence rate (IR) of all 198 rare cancers in the period 2000-2010 was 147 per 100,000 per year, corresponding to about 89,000 new diagnoses in Italy each year, accounting for 25% of all cancer. Five cancers, rare at European level, were not rare in Italy because their IR was higher than 6 per 100,000; these tumours were: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and squamous cell carcinoma of larynx (whose IRs in Italy were 7 per 100,000), multiple myeloma (IR: 8 per 100,000), hepatocellular carcinoma (IR: 9 per 100,000) and carcinoma of thyroid gland (IR: 14 per 100,000). Among the remaining 193 rare cancers, more than two thirds (No. 139) had an annual IR <0.5 per 100,000, accounting for about 7,100 new cancers cases; for 25 cancer types, the IR ranged between 0.5 and 1 per 100,000, accounting for about 10,000 new diagnoses; while for 29 cancer types the IR was between 1 and 6 per 100,000, accounting for about 41,000 new cancer cases. Among all rare cancers diagnosed in Italy, 7% were rare haematological diseases (IR: 41 per 100,000), 18% were solid rare cancers. Among the latter, the rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system were the most common (23%, IR: 26 per 100,000), followed by epithelial tumours of head and neck (17%, IR: 19) and rare cancers of the female genital system (17%, IR: 17), endocrine tumours (13% including thyroid carcinomas and less than 1% with an IR of 0.4 excluding thyroid carcinomas), sarcomas (8%, IR: 9 per 100,000), central nervous system tumours and rare epithelial tumours of the thoracic cavity (5%with an IR equal to 6 and 5 per 100,000, respectively). The remaining (rare male genital tumours, IR: 4 per 100,000; tumours of eye, IR: 0.7 per 100,000; neuroendocrine tumours, IR: 4 per 100,000; embryonal tumours, IR: 0.4 per 100,000; rare skin tumours and malignant melanoma of mucosae, IR: 0.8 per 100,000) each constituted <4% of all solid rare cancers. Patients with rare cancers were on average younger than those with common cancers. Essentially, all childhood cancers were rare, while after age 40 years, the common cancers (breast, prostate, colon, rectum, and lung) became increasingly more frequent. For 254,821 rare cancers diagnosed in 2000-2008, 5-year RS was on average 55%, lower than the corresponding figures for patients with common cancers (68%). RS was lower for rare cancers than for common cancers at 1 year and continued to diverge up to 3 years, while the gap remained constant from 3 to 5 years after diagnosis. For rare and common cancers, survival decreased with increasing age. Five-year RS was similar and high for both rare and common cancers up to 54 years; it decreased with age, especially after 54 years, with the elderly (75+ years) having a 37% and 20% lower survival than those aged 55-64 years for rare and common cancers, respectively. We estimated that about 900,000 people were alive in Italy with a previous diagnosis of a rare cancer in 2010 (prevalence). The highest prevalence was observed for rare haematological diseases (278 per 100,000) and rare tumours of the female genital system (265 per 100,000). Very low prevalence (<10 prt 100,000) was observed for rare epithelial skin cancers, for rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system and rare epithelial tumours of the thoracic cavity. COMMENTS: One in four cancers cases diagnosed in Italy is a rare cancer, in agreement with estimates of 24% calculated in Europe overall. In Italy, the group of all rare cancers combined, include 5 cancer types with an IR>6 per 100,000 in Italy, in particular thyroid cancer (IR: 14 per 100,000).The exclusion of thyroid carcinoma from rare cancers reduces the proportion of them in Italy in 2010 to 22%. Differences in incidence across population can be due to the different distribution of risk factors (whether environmental, lifestyle, occupational, or genetic), heterogeneous diagnostic intensity activity, as well as different diagnostic capacity; moreover heterogeneity in accuracy of registration may determine some minor differences in the account of rare cancers. Rare cancers had worse prognosis than common cancers at 1, 3, and 5 years from diagnosis. Differences between rare and common cancers were small 1 year after diagnosis, but survival for rare cancers declined more markedly thereafter, consistent with the idea that treatments for rare cancers are less effective than those for common cancers. However, differences in stage at diagnosis could not be excluded, as 1- and 3-year RS for rare cancers was lower than the corresponding figures for common cancers. Moreover, rare cancers include many cancer entities with a bad prognosis (5-year RS <50%): cancer of head and neck, oesophagus, small intestine, ovary, brain, biliary tract, liver, pleura, multiple myeloma, acute myeloid and lymphatic leukaemia; in contrast, most common cancer cases are breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers, which have a good prognosis. The high prevalence observed for rare haematological diseases and rare tumours of the female genital system is due to their high incidence (the majority of haematological diseases are rare and gynaecological cancers added up to fairly high incidence rates) and relatively good prognosis. The low prevalence of rare epithelial tumours of the digestive system was due to the low survival rates of the majority of tumours included in this group (oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, and liver), regardless of the high incidence rate of rare epithelial cancers of these sites. This AIRTUM study confirms that rare cancers are a major public health problem in Italy and provides quantitative estimations, for the first time in Italy, to a problem long known to exist. This monograph provides detailed epidemiologic indicators for almost 200 rare cancers, the majority of which (72%) are very rare (IR<0.5 per 100,000). These data are of major interest for different stakeholders. Health care planners can find useful information herein to properly plan and think of how to reorganise health care services. Researchers now have numbers to design clinical trials considering alternative study designs and statistical approaches. Population-based cancer registries with good quality data are the best source of information to describe the rare cancer burden in a population.

Growing data show the association of metabolic syndrome (MetS) or its components with cancer development and cancer-related mortality. It is suggested that in MetS and cancer association, insulin resistance and insulin-like growth factor 1 system play a key role, especially adipokines secreted from visceral adipocytes, free fatty acids and aromatase activity contribute to this process. It is also reported that MetS has a link with colorectal, breast, endometrial, pancreas, primary liver and, although controversial, prostate cancer. Although every component of MetS is known to have an association with cancer development, it is still debated whether the effects of these components are additive or synergistic. On the other hand, in the association between MetS and cancer, the role of antidiabetic and antihypertensive treatments including thiazolidinedione, insulin, angiotensin receptor blockers is also suggested. The primary approach in MetS-cancer relation is to prevent risk factors. Life style changes including weight loss and a healthy diet are known to decrease cancer risk in normal population. It is postulated that an insulin-sensitizing agent, metformin, has cancer-preventing effects on diabetic patients. This review discusses the relationship between MetS and cancer from different aspects and examines this relationship in some of the cancers suggested to be linked with MetS.

Open clinical trial data offer many opportunities for the scientific community to independently verify published results, evaluate new hypotheses and conduct meta-analyses. These data provide a springboard for scientific advances in precision medicine but the question arises as to how representative clinical trials data are of cancer patients overall. Here we present the integrative analysis of data from several cancer clinical trials and compare these to patient-level data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Comparison of cancer type-specific survival rates reveals that these are overall lower in trial subjects. This effect, at least to some extent, can be explained by the more advanced stages of cancer of trial subjects. This analysis also reveals that for stage IV cancer, colorectal cancer patients have a better chance of survival than breast cancer patients. On the other hand, for all other stages, breast cancer patients have better survival than colorectal cancer patients. Comparison of survival in different stages of disease between the two datasets reveals that subjects with stage IV cancer from the trials dataset have a lower chance of survival than matching stage IV subjects from TCGA. One likely explanation for this observation is that stage IV trial subjects have lower survival rates since their cancer is less likely to respond to treatment. To conclude, we present here a newly available clinical trials dataset which allowed for the integration of patient-level data from many cancer clinical trials. Our comprehensive analysis reveals that cancer-related clinical trials are not representative of general cancer patient populations, mostly due to their focus on the more advanced stages of the disease. These and other limitations of clinical trials data should, perhaps, be taken into consideration in medical research and in the field of precision medicine.

BACKGROUND: Cancer patients who usually consult the general practitioner (GP) rarely are generally diagnosed with more advanced stages of cancer. This subgroup of cancer patients may thus postpone relevant healthcare seeking. AIM: We aimed to investigate the rates of daytime face-to-face consultations in general practice before a cancer diagnosis in patients with different categories of 'usual' consultation frequency. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted a population-based comparative study using register data on all 123,934 first-time cancer patients aged 50-90 years who were diagnosed in 2009-2013 in Denmark. Usual consultation rates were based on number of consultations from 19 to 36 months before cancer diagnosis. We predicted the marginal monthly consultation rates for up to 18 months before diagnosis. These were based on the estimated (mean) rates of consultations with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), which were calculated by negative binomial regression analysis with robust variance estimation. RESULTS: Patients with cancer began to increase their consultation frequency four to six months before their cancer diagnosis. The average monthly consultation rates varied slightly across usual consultation groups; rates were lowest among male 'frequent' consulters (0.28 (95% CI: 0.27;0.29)) and highest among female 'frequent' consulters (0.35 (95% CI: 0.34;0.37)). The additional number of consultations was 1-2 for all combinations of usual consultation frequency, sex, and cancer type (except for female breast cancer and 'average' consulters with lung or prostate cancer). CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer begin to increase their consultation frequency in general practice before a cancer diagnosis independently of their usual consultation frequency.

BACKGROUND: Falls in older adults with cancer are common, yet factors associated with fall-risk are not well-defined and may differ from the general geriatric population. This study aims to develop and validate a model of factors associated with prior falls among older adults with cancer. METHODS: In this cross-sectional secondary analysis, two cohorts of patients aged >/= 65 with cancer were examined to develop and validate a model of factors associated with falls in the prior 6 months. Potential independent variables, including demographic and laboratory data and a geriatric assessment (encompassing comorbidities, functional status, physical performance, medications, and psychosocial status), were identified. A multivariate model was developed in the derivation cohort using an exhaustive modeling approach. The model selected for validation offered a low Akaike Information Criteria value and included dichotomized variables for ease of clinical use. This model was then applied in the validation cohort. RESULTS: The development cohort (N = 498) had a mean age of 73 (range 65-91). Nearly one-fifth (18.2%) reported a fall in the prior 6 months. The selected model comprised nine variables involving functional status, objective physical performance, depression, medications, and renal function. The AUC of the model was 0.72 (95% confidence intervals 0.65-0.78). In the validation cohort (N = 250), the prevalence of prior falls was 23.6%. The AUC of the model in the validation cohort was 0.62 (95% confidence intervals 0.51-0.71). CONCLUSION: In this study, we developed and validated a model of factors associated with prior falls in older adults with cancer. Future study is needed to examine the utility of such a model in prospectively predicting incident falls.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) reduces quality of life and the activity level of patients with cancer. Cancer related fatigue can be reduced by exercise interventions that may concurrently increase muscle mass. We hypothesized that low muscle mass is directly related to higher CRF. METHODS: A total of 233 patients with advanced cancer starting palliative chemotherapy for lung, colorectal, breast, or prostate cancer were studied. The skeletal muscle index (SMI) was calculated as the patient's muscle mass on level L3 or T4 of a computed tomography scan, adjusted for height. Fatigue was assessed with the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-fatigue questionnaire (cut-off for fatigue <34). Multiple linear regression analyses were conducted to study the association between SMI and CRF adjusting for relevant confounders. RESULTS: In this group of patients with advanced cancer, the median fatigue score was 36 (interquartile range 26-44). A higher SMI on level L3 was significantly associated with less CRF for men (B 0.447, P 0.004) but not for women (B - 0.401, P 0.090). No association between SMI on level T4 and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-fatigue score was found (n = 82). CONCLUSIONS: The association between SMI and CRF may lead to the suggestion that male patients may be able to reduce fatigue by exercise interventions aiming at an increased muscle mass. In women with advanced cancer, CRF is more influenced by other causes, because it is not significantly related to muscle mass. To further reduce CRF in both men and women with cancer, multifactorial assessments need to be performed in order to develop effective treatment strategies.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is a major cause of morbidity and mortality after heart transplantation. METHODS: We studied 541 heart transplant patients from a single center over a period of 25 years, with a mean follow-up of 10.7 years. We determined incidence, type, risk factors, and prognosis for cancer after heart transplantation. RESULTS: Cancer was diagnosed in 181 patients, at a mean of 7.7 years after transplantation. Cumulative incidence of cancer at 5, 10, and 20 years was 14%, 29%, and 60%, respectively. The most frequent cancers were spinocellular skin cancer (22%), basocellular skin cancer (19%), lung cancer (16%), lymphoma (11%) and prostate cancer (10%). Age at transplantation > 50 years (hazard ratio, 2.9; P < .001) and male recipient gender (hazard ratio, 1.7; P = .038) were significant risk factors for posttransplant malignancy on multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis. Median patient survival after diagnosis of cancer was 2.9 years for patients with noncutaneous cancer, versus 13.1 years for patients with only skin cancer (P < .001).

OBJECTIVE: This study assessed a national healthcare intervention launched in Sweden in 2015 to reduce the time between macroscopic haematuria, diagnosis and treatment of urinary tract cancer. METHODS: The outcome of the first 11 months was evaluated in 1697 individuals referred to a standardized care pathway for urinary tract cancer compared with 174 patients with conventionally diagnosed urothelial carcinoma. RESULTS: Among the referred individuals, 317 (19%) were diagnosed with cancer, 1034 (61%) had a benign diagnosis and 345 (20%) had a negative evaluation. Bladder cancer was the most common malignant diagnosis [262/317 (83%)]. Cancers were diagnosed in 23% of males and 13% of females, and showed a strong correlation with age: cancer diagnosis in 2% aged <50 years and in 44% aged >/=90 years. Results were affected by bacteriuria but not by anticoagulant medication, with 12%/22% and 19%/19% cancer detection, respectively. The standardized care pathway shortened the diagnostic delay to a median of 25 days compared to 35 days for regular referral (p = .01). However, median time to treatment was unchanged: 39 days from referral to transurethral resection, 42 days from primary resection to re-resection for stage TaG3/T1 disease and 100 days from referral to curative treatment for muscle-invasive disease. CONCLUSIONS: Macroscopic haematuria had a cancer capture rate of 19%, with higher predictive values in men and at older age, whereas anticoagulant therapy did not influence the diagnostic yield. The demonstrated lack of effect on time to treatment underscores the need to consider the entire patient process when initiating healthcare reforms to improve outcome.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of retroperitoneal (RP) exploration on progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) patients with stage IIIC disease who underwent optimal debulking surgery. METHODS: Data were collected from records of the Gynecologic Oncology Group 182 (GOG-182) study of stage IIIC EOC patients cytoreduced to no gross residual disease (R0) or minimal gross residual (<1 cm) disease (MGRD) at primary surgery. Patients with stage IIIC disease by intraperitoneal (IP) tumor were included and divided into 3 groups: 1) > 2 cm IP tumor without lymph node involvement (IP/RP-), 2) > 2 cm IP tumor with lymph node involvement (IP/RP+), and 3) > 2 cm IP tumor with no RP exploration (IP/RP?). The effects of disease distribution and RP exploration on PFS and OS were assessed using Kaplan-Meier and proportional hazards methods. RESULTS: There were 1871 stage IIIC patients in GOG-182 who underwent optimal primary debulking surgery. Of these, 689 (36.8%) underwent RP exploration with removal of lymph nodes from at least 1 para-aortic site, and 1182 (63.2%) did not. There were 269 patients in the IP/RP- group, 420 patients in the IP/RP + group, and 1182 patients in the IP/RP? group. Improved PFS (18.5 vs 16.0 months; P < .0001) and OS (53.3 vs 42.8 months; P < .0001) were associated with RP exploration versus no exploration. Patients with MGRD had improved PFS (16.8 vs 15.1 months, P = 0.0108) and OS (44.9 vs 40.5 months, P = 0.0076) versus no exploration. CONCLUSIONS: RP exploration at the time of primary surgery in patients with optimally debulked stage IIIC EOC is associated with a survival benefit. Cancer 2017;123:985-93.

How the news media cover cancer may have profound significance for cancer prevention and control; however, little is known about the actual content of cancer news coverage in Korea. This research thus aimed to examine news portrayal of specific cancer types with respect to threat and efficacy, and to investigate whether news portrayal corresponds to actual cancer statistics. A content analysis of 1,138 cancer news stories was conducted, using a representative sample from 23 news outlets (television, newspapers, and other news media) in Korea over a 5-year period from 2008 to 2012. Cancer incidence and mortality rates were obtained from the Korean Statistical Information Service. Results suggest that threat was most prominent in news stories on pancreatic cancer (with 87% of the articles containing threat information with specific details), followed by liver (80%) and lung cancers (70%), and least in stomach cancer (41%). Efficacy information with details was conveyed most often in articles on colorectal (54%), skin (54%), and liver (50%) cancers, and least in thyroid cancer (17%). In terms of discrepancies between news portrayal and actual statistics, the threat of pancreatic and liver cancers was overreported, whereas the threat of stomach and prostate cancers was underreported. Efficacy information regarding cervical and colorectal cancers was overrepresented in the news relative to cancer statistics; efficacy of lung and thyroid cancers was underreported. Findings provide important implications for medical professionals to understand news information about particular cancers as a basis for public (mis)perception, and to communicate effectively about cancer risk with the public and patients.

STUDY OBJECTIVES: Epidemiological evidence from relatively small cohorts suggests that obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with higher cancer incidence and mortality. Here we aimed to determine whether cancer incidence for major cancer types and risk of metastases or mortality from cancer are increased in the presence of OSA. METHODS: All OSA diagnoses included in an employee-sponsored health insurance database spanning the years 2003-2012 were identified and 1:1 matched demographically based on age, gender, and state of residence, or alternatively matched by comorbidities. The incidence of 12 types of cancer was assessed. In addition, another cohort of patients with a primary diagnosis of cancer was retrieved, and the risk of metastatic disease or cancer mortality was determined as a function of the presence or absence of OSA. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were fitted to assess the independent associations between OSA and outcomes of interest. RESULTS: Based on a cohort of approximately 5.6 million individuals, the incidence of all cancer diagnoses combined was similar in OSA and retrospectively matched cases. However, the adjusted risk of pancreatic and kidney cancer and melanoma were significantly higher in patients with OSA, while the risk of colorectal, breast, and prostate cancers appeared to be lower. Among individuals with a diagnosis of cancer, the presence of OSA was not associated with an increased risk for metastasis or death. CONCLUSIONS: In a large nationally representative health insurance database, OSA appears to increase the risk for only a very selective number of cancer types, and does not appear to be associated with an increased risk of metastatic cancer or cancer-related deaths.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer is one of the 5 most common malignancies in adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients (ages 15-39 years) and may develop de novo or in patients previously treated for cancer. This study compared the tumor characteristics, treatment, and overall survival (OS) of secondary malignant neoplasm (SMN) versus primary thyroid cancer in AYA patients. METHODS: All cases of AYA thyroid cancer contained in the 1998 to 2010 American College of Surgeons National Cancer Database were divided into 2 cohorts according to primary or secondary occurrence. Comparisons using appropriate statistical methods were performed. RESULTS: Of 41,062 cases, 1349 (3.3%) had experienced a prior malignancy. Compared with cases of primary thyroid cancer, SMNs were more likely multifocal (odds ratio [OR] = 1.173, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.049-1.313) microcarcinomas < 1 cm (OR = 1.496, 95% CI = 1.327-1.687) with tall/columnar cells (OR = 2.187, 95% CI = 0.534-0.692), of white race (OR = 2.643, 95% CI = 1.310-5.331) and age 35-39 years (OR = 1.239, 95% CI = 1.093-1.404) and less likely female (OR = 0.608, 95% CI = 0.534-0.692), Hispanic (OR = 0.779, 95% CI = 0.642-0.946) age 15-19 years (OR = 0.624, 95% CI = 0.510-0.763) or 25-29 years (OR = 0.711, 95% CI = 0.604-0.837), or less likely > 4 cm in size (OR = 0.610, 95% CI = 0.493-0.758). There was a 6.63-fold (95% CI = 4.97-8.86, P < .001) relative risk of death for secondary versus primary thyroid cancers after adjusting for demographic, tumor, and thyroid treatment factors. Only Hispanic origin, tall/columnar cell histology, and distant metastases decreased OS for SMNs. CONCLUSIONS: AYAs who develop thyroid cancer as a SMN have a significantly decreased OS compared to AYAs with primary thyroid cancer. Multiple demographic and tumor differences exist between these 2 cohorts. Whether the outcome disparity results from previous cancer treatment or differences in biology, environment, or access to care are areas needing further investigation.

The purpose of the present review is to give an overview of the association between alcohol intake and the risk of developing cancer. Two large-scale expert reports; the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF)/American Institute of Cancer Research (AICR) report from 2007, including its continuous update project, and the International Agency for Research of Cancer (IARC) monograph from 2012 have extensively reviewed this association in the last decade. We summarize and compare their findings, as well as relate these to the public health impact, with a particular focus on region-specific drinking patterns and disease tendencies. Our findings show that alcohol intake is strongly linked to the risk of developing cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, oesophagus, colorectum (in men), and female breast. The two expert reports diverge on the evidence for an association with liver cancer and colorectal cancer in women, which the IARC grades as convincing, but the WCRF/AICR as probable. Despite these discrepancies, there does, however, not seem to be any doubt, that the Population Attributable Fraction of alcohol in relation to cancer is large. As alcohol intake varies largely worldwide, so does, however, also the Population Attributable Fractions, ranging from 10% in Europe to almost 0% in countries where alcohol use is banned. Given the World Health Organization's prediction, that alcohol intake is increasing, especially in low- and middle-income countries, and steadily high in high-income countries, the need for preventive efforts to curb the number of alcohol-related cancers seems growing, as well as the need for taking a region- and gender-specific approach in both future campaigns as well as future research. The review acknowledges the potential beneficial effects of small doses of alcohol in relation to ischaemic heart disease, but a discussion of this lies without the scope of the present study.

BACKGROUND: Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4) is recognized as a potential biomarker for assessing cancer prognosis. Many experiments have been done to explore the aberrant expression of SALL4 in cancer patients. OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between SALL4 expression and cancer prognosis. METHODS: A systematically comprehensive search was performed through PubMed, Web of Science, and CNKI. The prognostic value of SALL4 expression in cancer patients was evaluated by pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The overexpression of SALL4 was identified to be significantly associated with a poor prognosis in cancer patients (pooled HR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.67-2.46). This association was also detected in digestive system neoplasms subgroup (pooled HR: 1.91, 95% CI: 1.52-2.39) and reproductive system neoplasms subgroup (pooled HR: 1.95, 95% CI: 1.17-3.26). In the geography subgroup analysis, a statistical association was confirmed in the Chinese subgroup (pooled HR: 1.982, 95% CI: 1.526-2.576). In the respect of disease progression, there was a certain degree of relationship between higher expression of SALL4 and recurrence-free survival (RFS) (pooled HR: 1.617, 95% CI: 1.190-2.196). CONCLUSION: SALL4 is a promising prognostic biomarker for cancer, and is appropriate for the assessment of cancer prognosis in the Chinese people.

BACKGROUND: Rhabdomyosarcoma survivors have an increased risk of developing second malignant neoplasms (SMN); this risk is traditionally attributed to the effects of multidisciplinary management required for cure. However, the impact of constitutional predisposition has not been properly analyzed. METHODS: We analyzed the risk of SMN among 1,151 children diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma and reported to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries (SEER-9) from 1973 to 2010. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using SEERStat 8.1.2. RESULTS: Children with pleomorphic and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma had an increased risk of developing a SMN (SIR = 15.77, 95%CI 1.91-56.96 and SIR = 5.6, 95%CI 3.32-8.85, respectively). The risk was age-dependent; the highest was among children <2 years (SIR = 13.38, 95%CI 4.34-31.22) and the lowest was in children >10 years (SIR = 3.35, 95%CI 1.53-6.35). The risk for the youngest patients was higher for those with embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (SIR = 14.72, 95%CI 4.01-37.70) compared to other histiotypes. Additionally, the risk of SMN was independent of the use of radiation to the primary (SIR = 6.50, 95%CI 3.97-10.03 and SIR = 4.57, 95%CI 2.09-8.68, for children receiving and not receiving radiation, respectively). The pattern of SMN observed was consistent with the Li-Fraumeni spectrum. CONCLUSIONS: Children with rhabdomyosarcoma are at high risk of developing SMN. This risk is higher for a subgroup of young children with pleomorphic and embryonal histologies, and is independent of the use of radiation. This suggests that a subgroup of children with pleomorphic and embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma may have a constitutional cancer predisposition.

BACKGROUND: Cancer risk is associated with serum iron levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether haematological parameters reflect serum iron levels and may also be associated with cancer risk. METHODS: We studied 1564 men and 1769 women who were enrolled in the Busselton Health Study, Western Australia. Haematological parameters evaluated included haemoglobin (Hb), mean cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) and mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) and red cell distribution width (RCDW). Statistical analyses included t-tests for quantitative variables, chi-square tests for categorical variables and Cox proportional hazards regression modelling for cancer incidence and death. RESULTS: There was marginal evidence of an association between MCV (as a continuous variable) and non-skin cancer incidence in women (HR 1.15, 95% CI 1.013, 1.302; p = 0.030) but the hazard ratio was attenuated to non-significance after adjustment for serum ferritin (SF), iron and transferrin saturation (TS) (HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.972, 1.264; p = 0.126). There was strong evidence of an association between MCHC and prostate cancer incidence in men; the estimated hazard ratio for an increase of one SD (0.5) in MCHC was 1.27 (95% CI 1.064, 1.507; p = 0.008). These results remained significant after further adjustment for SF and iron; the estimated hazard ratio for an increase of one SD (0.5) in MCHC was 1.25 (p = 0.014, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.48). CONCLUSIONS: The MCHC and MCV were associated with cancer incidence in a Western Australian population, although only MCHC remained associated with prostate cancer after adjusting with serum iron and TS (circulating iron) and SF (storage iron). Haematological parameters are thus of limited utility in population profiling for future cancer risk.

Bioactive lipids are essential components of human cells and tissues. As discussed in this review, the cancer lipidome is diverse and malleable, with the ability to promote or inhibit cancer pathogenesis. Targeting lipids within the tumor and surrounding microenvironment may be a novel therapeutic approach for treating cancer patients. Additionally, the emergence of a novel super-family of lipid mediators termed specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) has revealed a new role for bioactive lipid mediators in the resolution of inflammation in cancer biology. The role of SPMs in cancer holds great promise in our understanding of cancer pathogenesis and can ultimately be used in future cancer diagnostics and therapy.

BACKGROUND: Intravenous ascorbic acid (IV AA) has been used extensively in cancer patients throughout the United States. Currently, there are limited data on the safety and clinical effects of IV AA. The purpose of this study was to expand the current literature using a retrospective analysis of adverse events and symptomatic changes of IV AA in a large sample of cancer patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all patients receiving IV AA for cancer at the Thomas Jefferson University Hospital over a 7-year period. We assessed all reports of adverse events, laboratory findings, and hospital or emergency department admissions. We also reviewed quality-of-life data, including fatigue, nausea, pain, appetite, and mood. RESULTS: There were 86 patients who received a total of 3034 doses of IV AA ranging from 50 to 150g. In all, 32 patients received only ascorbic acid as part of their cancer management (1197 doses), whereas 54 patients received ascorbic acid in conjunction with chemotherapy (1837 doses). The most common adverse events related to ascorbic acid were temporary nausea and discomfort at the injection site. All events reported in the ascorbic acid alone group were associated with less than 3% of the total number of infusions. Patients, overall, reported improvements in fatigue, pain, and mood while receiving ascorbic acid. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this retrospective analysis support the growing evidence that IV AA is generally safe and well tolerated in patients with cancer, and may be useful in symptom management and improving quality of life.

AIMS: Despite increasing use of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and reports linking selected bio-implants with cancer, the cancer risk associated with implanted ICDs remains unknown. The objective of our study was to examine cancer risk among ICD recipients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We conducted a population-based cohort study using medical registries covering the entire Danish population. We identified all first-time ICD recipients during the period of 2000-11 and determined their subsequent cancer incidence. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were computed by comparing observed cancer incidence in the ICD cohort with expected cancer incidence based on national incidence rates according to age, sex, and year of diagnosis. A total of 6723 ICD recipients were followed for up to 12 years (median 2.8 years) and contributed a total of 23 254 person-years of follow-up. Compared with the general population, ICD recipients had a slightly elevated overall risk of cancer [SIR = 1.1 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0-1.2)]. This was driven by the cancer risk among patients with ischaemic heart disease (IHD) [SIR = 1.1 (95% CI: 1.0-1.3)], which, as expected, was particularly elevated for tobacco-related cancers [SIR = 1.4 (95% CI: 1.2-1.6)]. Importantly, ICD recipients without IHD were not at increased cancer risk [SIR = 1.0 (95% CI: 0.8-1.3)]. CONCLUSION: This nationwide population-based cohort study with up to 12-year follow-up did not indicate a causal relation between ICD implantation and cancer. However, more follow-up data are needed to entirely rule out risks for individual cancer types.

The aim of this study is to detect the accumulation status of organochlorine pesticides in breast cancer patients and to explore the relationship between organochlorine pesticides contamination and breast cancer development. We conducted a hospital-based case-control study in 56 patients with breast cancer and 46 patients with benign breast disease. We detected the accumulation level of several organochlorine pesticides products (beta-hexachlorocyclohexane, gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, polychlorinated biphenyls-28, polychlorinated biphenyls-52, pentachlorothioanisole, and pp'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane) in breast adipose tissues of all 102 patients using gas chromatography. Thereafter, we examined the expression status of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), and Ki-67 in 56 breast cancer cases by immunohistochemistry. In addition, we analyzed the risk of breast cancer in those patients with organochlorine pesticides contamination using a logistic regression model. Our data showed that breast cancer patients suffered high accumulation levels of pp'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane and polychlorinated biphenyls-52. However, the concentrations of pp'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane and polychlorinated biphenyls-52 were not related to clinicopathologic parameters of breast cancer. Further logistic regression analysis showed polychlorinated biphenyls-52 and pp'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane were risk factors for breast cancer. Our results provide new evidence on etiology of breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: It has been reported that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)-induced inflammatory markers, such as circulating neopterin and kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratio (KTR), are increased in patients with cancer and are also a predictor of poor prognosis. However, whether baseline levels of these makers are associated with subsequent cancer risk in the general population remains unknown. METHODS: We conducted a prospective analysis of the Hordaland Health Study in 6594 adults without known cancer at baseline who were enrolled between April 1998 and June 1999. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models adjusted for sex, age, body mass index, smoking status, and renal function. RESULTS: A total of 971 incident cancer cases (507 men and 464 women) were identified over a median follow-up time of 12 years. Baseline plasma neopterin, KTR and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly associated with an increased risk of overall cancer in models adjusted for covariates (P for trend across quartiles = .006 for neopterin, .022 for KTR, and .005 for CRP). The multivariate-adjusted HR (95% CI) per SD increment in similar models were 1.09 (1.03-1.16) for neopterin, 1.07 (1.01-1.14) for KTR, and 1.04 (0.98-1.10) for CRP. The associations between the inflammatory markers and risk of major specific cancer types were also provided. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that plasma neopterin, KTR, and CRP are associated with a significantly increased risk of overall cancer. Our study revealed novel evidence regarding the role of IFN-gamma-induced inflammation in human carcinogenesis.

BACKGROUND: The members of the slit homolog (SLIT) and roundabout homolog (ROBO) families have emerged as important signaling molecules in tumor metastasis. This study analyzed their role in regulating breast cancer (BC) cell motility and chemotaxis and assessed expression of ROBO1 in brain metastases (BMs) of breast, lung, and colon cancer, and in peritoneal metastases (PMs) of ovarian cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The BC cell line MDA-MB231 was subjected to scratch, motility, and chemotaxis assays using heparin and a purified recombinant N-terminal SLIT2 fragment. Protein expression was assessed in primary tumors and metastases by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Exposure to SLIT2 induced MDA-MB231 cell motility, but no significant chemotaxis without the presence of heparin. ROBO1 was expressed in 4/5 primary BC and in 18/21 BC-derived BM samples; 7/9 BM primary lung cancer samples also stained positive. In contrast, BMs from colorectal cancer were negative for ROBO1. Primary ovarian cancer and ovarian PM showed ROBO1 expression in 0/6 and in only 2/6 samples, respectively, whereas SLIT2 was observed in 1/6 primary cancer and in 6/6 PMs samples. CONCLUSION: SLIT2 can induce BC cell motility and chemotaxis, but the latter requires the presence of heparin. BM expression of ROBO1 is a common feature of some, but not all cancer types. SLIT2 expression appears to be a general feature of ovarian cancer-derived PMs.

BACKGROUND: Increasing age is a risk factor for developing cancer. Yet, older people commonly underestimate this risk, are less likely to be aware of the early symptoms, and are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced stage cancer. Mass media are a key influence on the public's understanding health issues, including cancer risk. This study investigates how news media have represented age and other risk factors in the most common cancers over time. METHODS: Eight hundred articles about the four most common cancers (breast, prostate, lung and colorectal) published within eight UK national newspapers in 2003, 2004, 2013 and 2014 were identified using the Nexis database. Relevant manifest content of articles was coded quantitatively and subjected to descriptive statistical analysis in SPSS to identify patterns across the data. RESULTS: Risk was presented in half of the articles but this was rarely discussed in any depth and around a quarter of all articles introduced more than one risk factor, irrespective of cancer site. Age was mentioned as a risk factor in approximately 12% of all articles and this varied by cancer site. Age was most frequently reported in relation to prostate cancer and least often in articles about lung cancer. Articles featuring personal narratives more frequently focused on younger people and this was more pronounced in non-celebrity stories; only 15% of non-celebrity narratives were about people over 60. Other common risks discussed were family history and genetics, smoking, diet, alcohol, and environmental factors. Family history and genetics together featured as the most common risk factors. Risk factor reporting varied by site and family history was most commonly associated with breast cancer, diet with bowel cancer and smoking with lung cancer. CONCLUSION: Age and older adults were largely obscured in media representation of cancer and cancer experience. Indeed common risk factors in general were rarely discussed in any depth. Our findings will usefully inform the development of future cancer awareness campaigns and media guidelines. It is important that older adults appreciate their heightened risk, particularly in the context of help-seeking decisions.

PURPOSE: Male breast cancer is associated with female breast cancer in families but whether male breast cancer clusters with other discordant cancers has not been studied. As concordant male breast cancers are utterly rare, discordant associations of male breast cancer with other cancers may reveal genetic and possible environmental risk factors contributing to male breast cancer susceptibility. METHODS: We calculated relative risks (RRs) for male breast cancer in families with discordant cancers, and conversely, for discordant cancers in families of male breast cancer patients, based on 15.7 million individuals in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database. RESULTS: Among 1428 male breast cancer patients, 16.2% had a female relative diagnosed with breast cancer. Ovarian and female anal cancers showed the strongest associations with male breast cancer (p value < 0.0005). The other significant associations included colorectal, small intestinal, and thyroid cancers, cancer of unknown primary and non-Hodgkin lymphoma but these were each based on a single positive association with male breast cancer. The RRs for male breast cancer were increased in families in which multiple patients were diagnosed with diverse cancers, reaching an RR of 2.58 when three or more family members were affected. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that male breast cancer shares susceptibility with a number of other cancers but confirmation is needed in other datasets.

BACKGROUND: Obese men are at higher risk of advanced prostate cancer and cancer-specific mortality; however, the biology underlying this association remains unclear. This study examined gene expression profiles of prostate tissue to identify biological processes differentially expressed by obesity status and lethal prostate cancer. METHODS: Gene expression profiling was performed on tumor (n = 402) and adjacent normal (n = 200) prostate tissue from participants in 2 prospective cohorts who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer from 1982 to 2005. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from the questionnaire immediately preceding cancer diagnosis. Men were followed for metastases or prostate cancer-specific death (lethal disease) through 2011. Gene Ontology biological processes differentially expressed by BMI were identified using gene set enrichment analysis. Pathway scores were computed by averaging the signal intensities of member genes. Odds ratios (ORs) for lethal prostate cancer were estimated with logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 402 men, 48% were healthy weight, 31% were overweight, and 21% were very overweight/obese. Fifteen gene sets were enriched in tumor tissue, but not normal tissue, of very overweight/obese men versus healthy-weight men; 5 of these were related to chromatin modification and remodeling (false-discovery rate < 0.25). Patients with high tumor expression of chromatin-related genes had worse clinical characteristics (Gleason grade > 7, 41% vs 17%; P = 2 x 10(-4) ) and an increased risk of lethal disease that was independent of grade and stage (OR, 5.26; 95% confidence interval, 2.37-12.25). CONCLUSIONS: This study improves our understanding of the biology of aggressive prostate cancer and identifies a potential mechanistic link between obesity and prostate cancer death that warrants further study.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for localized prostate cancer has potential advantages over traditional radiotherapies. Herein, the authors compared national trends in use, complications, and costs of SBRT with those of traditional radiotherapies. METHODS: The authors identified men who underwent SBRT, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), brachytherapy, and proton beam therapy as primary treatment of prostate cancer between 2004 and 2011 from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER)-Medicare linked data. Temporal trend of therapy use was assessed using the Cochran-Armitage test. Two-year outcomes were compared using the chi-square test. Median treatment costs were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. RESULTS: A total of 542 men received SBRT, 9647 received brachytherapy, 23,408 received IMRT, and 800 men were treated with proton beam therapy. There was a significant increase in the use of SBRT and proton beam therapy (P<.001), whereas brachytherapy use decreased (P<.001). A higher percentage of patients treated with SBRT and brachytherapy had low-grade cancer (Gleason score </= 6 vs >/= 7) compared with individuals treated with IMRT and proton beam therapy (54.0% and 64.2% vs 35.2% and 49.6%, respectively; P<.001). SBRT compared with brachytherapy and IMRT was associated with equivalent gastrointestinal toxicity but more erectile dysfunction at 2-year follow-up (P<.001). SBRT was associated with more urinary incontinence compared with IMRT and proton beam therapy but less compared with brachytherapy (P<.001, respectively). The median cost of SBRT was $27,145 compared with $17,183 for brachytherapy, $37,090 for IMRT, and $54,706 for proton beam therapy (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: The use of SBRT and proton beam therapy for localized prostate cancer has increased over time. Despite men of lower disease stage undergoing SBRT, SBRT was found to be associated with greater toxicity but lower health care costs compared with IMRT and proton beam therapy.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the ability of the Vulnerable Elders Survey (VES-13) to predict the composite outcome of functional decline and death within 12 months of breast cancer treatment among women 65 years old or older with newly diagnosed stage I to III breast cancer. METHODS: Two hundred and six participants were recruited from ambulatory oncology clinics at an academic center between April 2008 and April 2013. Participants competed the VES-13 at baseline just before neoadjuvant/adjuvant treatment. The primary outcome, functional decline/death, was defined as either a decrease of at least 1 point on the Activities of Daily Living scale and/or the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scale or death between baseline and 12 months (yes or no). RESULTS: One hundred and eighty four participants (89%) completed 12 months of follow-up. Twenty-two percent functionally declined (n = 34) or died (n = 7). Univariately, with increasing VES-13 scores, the estimated risk of functional decline/death rose from 23% for participants with a VES-13 score of 3 to 76% for participants with a VES-13 score of 10. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, VES-13 scores (adjusted odds ratio, 1.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.57) and having a high school education or less (adjusted odds ratio, 2.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-5.65) were independent predictors of functional decline/death (area under the receiver operator curve, 0.79). CONCLUSIONS: Among older women with newly diagnosed nonmetastatic breast cancer, approximately 1 in 5 functionally declined and/or died within 12 months of breast cancer treatment initiation. Women with high school education or less were disproportionately affected. The VES-13 is a useful instrument for the early identification of those at risk for functional decline and/or death.

BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the incidence of cancer in young adults (20-39 years) is increasing, and represents an important cause of mortality in this age group. A retrospective study was undertaken to provide information that may lead to improved treatment outcomes. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinicopathological, treatment, and survival information were retrieved from the electronic database registry of a tertiary referral hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil for patients 19-29 years of age diagnosed with cancer between January 2007 and December 2012. RESULTS: There were 960 patients with a median age at diagnosis of 26 years; female patients comprised 59.2%. A previous diagnosis of malignancy was present in 2.3%; 0.4% had malignant tumors that were radiation-associated; regular alcohol use was present in 10.4%; 9% of patients reported tobacco use; a family history of cancer was present in 41.7%. Malignant tumors included carcinomas (45.7%), germ cell and trophoblastic neoplasms (12.3%), and lymphomas (12.1%). Median follow-up was 47.7 months (range: 0.62-100.9 months) during which time 111 patients (13.5%) died. Carcinomas (n = 43, 38.7%), soft tissue sarcomas (n = 18, 16.2%), and leukemias (n = 10, 9.0%) were the most common causes of death. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that carcinomas represent the most common malignancy in adolescents and young adults referred to a tertiary cancer center in Brazil and are the most common cause of mortality. Because clinical outcome may be affected by multiple factors in this patient population, further global studies are needed to characterize this population and improve clinical care.

BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a predominantly human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven disease worldwide. However, its incidence is unexplainably low in western Asia, including Saudi Arabia. Using this paradigm, we investigated the role of HPV infection rate and host genetic predisposition in TP53 G72C single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) presumed to affect cancer incidence. METHODS: Patients treated between 1990 and 2012 were reviewed, and a series of 232 invasive cervical cancer cases were studied and compared with 313 matched controls without cancer. SNP was genotyped by way of direct sequencing. HPV linear array analysis was used to detect and genotype HPV in tumor samples. RESULTS: The incidence of cervical cancer revealed bimodal peaks at 42.5 years, with a slighter rebound at 60.8 years. Among all cases, 77% were HPV-positive and 16 HPV genotypes were detected-mostly genotypes 16 (75%) and 18 (9%)-with no difference by age, histology, or geographical region. Although the TP53 G72C genotype was not associated with overall cervical cancer risk, it was significantly associated with HPV positivity (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-0.90; P = .016). Furthermore, the variant C allele was significantly overtransmitted in the population (P < .0003). CONCLUSION: Cervical cancer incidence displays bimodal curve peaking at a young age with secondary rebound at older age. The combination of relative low HPV infection and variant TP53 72C allele overtransmission provide a plausible explanation for the low incidence of cervical cancer in our population. Therefore, HPV screening and host SNP genotyping may provide more relevant biomarkers to gauge the risk of developing cervical cancer. Cancer 2017;123:2459-66. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

OBJECTIVES: Cancer in young adults represents a great challenge, both biologically and socially, and understanding the unique characteristics of neoplasms in this age group is important to improving care. We aimed to evaluate the most common carcinomas and their characteristics, such as histological type and clinical stage, in young adults in the largest cancer hospital in Latin America. METHODS: The hospital registry was consulted for the period between 2008 and 2014. Young adults were defined as individuals aged 18 to 39 years, and older adults were defined as individuals aged 40 years and older. Differences between age groups were assessed through chi-square tests. RESULTS: Of the 39,389 patients included, 3,821 (9.7%) were young adults. Among the young adults, the most frequent cancer types were the following: breast, lymph node, colorectal, thyroid, testicle, hematopoietic and reticuloendothelial, uterine cervix, brain, soft tissue and stomach; these sites accounted for 74.5% of the observed tumors. Breast, colorectal and stomach cancers were more frequently diagnosed at advanced stages in young adults than in older adults (p<0.001). The most common histological types were infiltrating ductal carcinoma (86.12%) for breast cancer, adenocarcinomas not otherwise specified (45.35%) for colorectal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma not otherwise specified (65.26%) for uterine cervix cancer, signet ring cell adenocarcinomas (49.32%) for stomach cancer and adenocarcinomas not otherwise specified (50.79%) for lung cancer. CONCLUSION: Young adults are diagnosed with cancer at more advanced stages, indicating that health professionals should be aware of cancer incidence in this age group. It is necessary to develop a better understanding of cancer in young adults and to implement dedicated health care strategies for these patients.

Issue addressed: Screening for cancer of the cervix, breast and bowel can reduce morbidity and mortality. Low participation rates in cancer screening have been identified among migrant communities internationally. Attempting to improve low rates of cancer screening, the Ethnic Communities Council of Queensland developed a pilot Cancer Screening Education Program for breast, bowel and cervical cancer. This study determines the impact of education sessions on knowledge, attitudes and intentions to participate in screening for culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities living in Brisbane, Queensland.Methods: Seven CALD groups (Arabic-speaking, Bosnian, South Asian (including Indian and Bhutanese), Samoan and Pacific Island, Spanish-speaking, Sudanese and Vietnamese) participated in a culturally-tailored cancer screening education pilot program that was developed using the Health Belief Model. A pre- and post-education evaluation session measured changes in knowledge, attitudes and intention related to breast, bowel and cervical cancer and screening. The evaluation focussed on perceived susceptibility, perceived seriousness and the target population's beliefs about reducing risk by cancer screening.Results: There were 159 participants in the three cancer screening education sessions. Overall participants' knowledge increased, some attitudes toward participation in cancer screening became more positive and intent to participate in future screening increased (n=146).Conclusion: These results indicate the importance of developing screening approaches that address the barriers to participation among CALD communities and that a culturally-tailored education program is effective in improving knowledge, attitudes about and intentions to participate in cancer screening.So what?: It is important that culturally-tailored programs are developed in conjunction with communities to improve health outcomes.

Contemporary information on the fraction of cancers that potentially could be prevented is useful for priority setting in cancer prevention and control. Herein, the authors estimate the proportion and number of invasive cancer cases and deaths, overall (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) and for 26 cancer types, in adults aged 30 years and older in the United States in 2014, that were attributable to major, potentially modifiable exposures (cigarette smoking; secondhand smoke; excess body weight; alcohol intake; consumption of red and processed meat; low consumption of fruits/vegetables, dietary fiber, and dietary calcium; physical inactivity; ultraviolet radiation; and 6 cancer-associated infections). The numbers of cancer cases were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Cancer Institute; the numbers of deaths were obtained from the CDC; risk factor prevalence estimates were obtained from nationally representative surveys; and associated relative risks of cancer were obtained from published, large-scale pooled analyses or meta-analyses. In the United States in 2014, an estimated 42.0% of all incident cancers (659,640 of 1570,975 cancers, excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers) and 45.1% of cancer deaths (265,150 of 587,521 deaths) were attributable to evaluated risk factors. Cigarette smoking accounted for the highest proportion of cancer cases (19.0%; 298,970 cases) and deaths (28.8%; 169,180 deaths), followed by excess body weight (7.8% and 6.5%, respectively) and alcohol intake (5.6% and 4.0%, respectively). Lung cancer had the highest number of cancers (184,970 cases) and deaths (132,960 deaths) attributable to evaluated risk factors, followed by colorectal cancer (76,910 cases and 28,290 deaths). These results, however, may underestimate the overall proportion of cancers attributable to modifiable factors, because the impact of all established risk factors could not be quantified, and many likely modifiable risk factors are not yet firmly established as causal. Nevertheless, these findings underscore the vast potential for reducing cancer morbidity and mortality through broad and equitable implementation of known preventive measures.

BACKGROUND: Surveys indicate quite high prevalence of cancer worry in the general population, but little is known about what it is about cancer that worries people. A better understanding of the origins of cancer worry may help elucidate previously found inconsistencies in its behavioural effect on cancer prevention, screening uptake, and help-seeking for symptoms. In this study, we explore the prevalence and population distribution of general cancer worry and worries about specific aspects of cancer previously identified. METHODS: A population-based survey of 2048 English adults (18-70 years, April-May 2016), using face-to-face interviews to assess demographic characteristics, general cancer worry and twelve sources of cancer worry (adapted from an existing scale), including the emotional, physical, and social consequences of a diagnosis. RESULTS: In general, a third of respondents (37%) never worried about cancer, 57% worried occasionally/sometimes, and 6% often/very often. In terms of specific worries, two thirds would be 'quite a bit' or 'extremely' worried about the threat to life and emotional upset a diagnosis would cause. Half would worry about surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and loss of control over life. Worries about the social consequences were less commonly anticipated: just under half would worry about financial problems or their social roles, and a quarter would be worried about effects on identity, important relationships, gender role, and sexuality. Women and younger people reported more frequent worry about getting cancer, and would be more worried about the emotional, physical, and social consequences of a cancer diagnosis (p < .001). Those from ethnic minority backgrounds reported less frequent worry about getting cancer than their white counterparts, but would be equally worried about the emotional and physical impact of a cancer diagnosis, and worried more about the social consequences of a cancer diagnosis (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: The majority of English adults worry at least occasionally about getting cancer, and would be most worried about the emotional and physical impact of a cancer diagnosis. Distinguishing between the various worries that cancer can evoke may help inform efforts to allay undue worries in those who are deterred by them from engaging with cancer prevention and early detection.

STUDY QUESTION: Do children born after donor ART have an increased risk of developing childhood cancer in comparison to the general population? SUMMARY ANSWER: This study showed no overall increased risk of childhood cancer in individuals born after donor ART. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Most large population-based studies have shown no increase in overall childhood cancer incidence after non-donor ART; however, other studies have suggested small increased risks in specific cancer types, including haematological cancers. Cancer risk specifically in children born after donor ART has not been investigated to date. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This retrospective cohort study utilized record linkage to determine the outcome status of all children born in Great Britain (1992-2008) after donor ART. The cohort included 12 137 members who contributed 95 389 person-years of follow-up (average follow-up 7.86 years). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Records of all children born in Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland) after all forms of donor ART (1992-2008) were linked to the UK National Registry of Childhood Tumours (NRCT) to determine the number who subsequently developed cancer by 15 years of age, by the end of 2008. Rates of overall and type specific cancer (selected a priori) were compared with age, sex and calendar year standardized population-based rates, stratifying for potential mediating/moderating factors including sex, age at diagnosis, birth weight, multiple births, maternal previous live births, assisted conception type and fresh/ cryopreserved cycles. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In our cohort of 12 137 children born after donor ART (52% male, 55% singleton births), no overall increased risk of cancer was identified. There were 12 cancers detected compared to 14.4 expected (standardized incidence ratio (SIR) 0.83; 95% CI 0.43-1.45; P = 0.50). A small, significant increased risk of hepatoblastoma was found, but the numbers and absolute risks were small (<5 cases observed; SIR 10.28; 95% CI 1.25-37.14; P < 0.05). This increased hepatoblastoma risk was associated with low birthweight. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although this study includes a large number of children born after donor ART, the rarity of specific diagnostic subgroups of childhood cancer results in few cases and therefore wide CIs for such outcomes. As this is an observational study, it is not possible to adjust for all potential confounders; we have instead used stratification to explore potential moderating and mediating factors, where data were available. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This is the first study to investigate cancer risk in children born after donor ART. Although based on small numbers, results are reassuring for families and clinicians. The small but significant increased risk of hepatoblastoma detected was associated with low birthweight, a known risk factor for this tumour type. It should be emphasized that the absolute risks are very small. However, on-going investigation with a longer follow-up is needed. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This work was funded by Cancer Research UK (C36038/A12535) and the National Institute for Health Research (405526) and supported by the National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust and University College London.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Previous work in rodent models showed that an autologous tissue vaccine is both a safe and effective approach for treating cancer; however, as a translational step, safety must first be evaluated in a more clinically-relevant model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An autologous immunotherapy produced from resected tumors, was evaluated in a clinically-relevant canine model to assess safety. Ninety-three dogs with spontaneously occurring tumors received vaccination with inactivated autologous tumor tissue combined with an adjuvant of particulate porcine small intestinal submucosa extracellular matrix (SIS-ECM). Patients were followed to assess the occurrence of adverse events, overall survival, and tumor recurrence and/or metastasis. RESULTS: A small number (12%) of patients experienced limited, mild pyrexia, injection site swelling, or lethargy, all resolving without clinical intervention. CONCLUSION: Autologous whole cell cancer immunotherapy can be used safely in the canine model of cancer and represents a safe approach for the treatment for cancer.

Claudin-2 promotes breast cancer liver metastasis by enabling seeding and early cancer cell survival. We now demonstrate that the PDZ-binding motif of Claudin-2 is necessary for anchorage-independent growth of cancer cells and is required for liver metastasis. Several PDZ domain-containing proteins were identified that interact with the PDZ-binding motif of Claudin-2 in liver metastatic breast cancer cells, including Afadin, Arhgap21, Pdlim2, Pdlim7, Rims2, Scrib, and ZO-1. We specifically examined the role of Afadin as a potential Claudin-2-interacting partner that promotes breast cancer liver metastasis. Afadin associates with Claudin-2, an interaction that requires the PDZ-binding motif of Claudin-2. Loss of Afadin also impairs the ability of breast cancer cells to form colonies in soft agar and metastasize to the lungs or liver. Immunohistochemical analysis of Claudin-2 and/or Afadin expression in 206 metastatic breast cancer tumors revealed that high levels of both Claudin-2 and Afadin in primary tumors were associated with poor disease-specific survival, relapse-free survival, lung-specific relapse, and liver-specific relapse. Our findings indicate that signaling downstream from a Claudin-2/Afadin complex enables the efficient formation of breast cancer metastases. Moreover, combining Claudin-2 and Afadin as prognostic markers better predicts the potential of breast cancer to metastasize to soft tissues.

Circadian disruption has been linked to carcinogenesis in animal models, but the evidence in humans is inconclusive. Genetic variation in circadian rhythm genes provides a tool to investigate such associations. We examined associations of genetic variation in nine core circadian rhythm genes and six melatonin pathway genes with risk of colorectal, lung, ovarian and prostate cancers using data from the Genetic Associations and Mechanisms in Oncology (GAME-ON) network. The major results for prostate cancer were replicated in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial, and for colorectal cancer in the Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO). The total number of cancer cases and controls was 15,838/18,159 for colorectal, 14,818/14,227 for prostate, 12,537/17,285 for lung and 4,369/9,123 for ovary. For each cancer site, we conducted gene-based and pathway-based analyses by applying the summary-based Adaptive Rank Truncated Product method (sARTP) on the summary association statistics for each SNP within the candidate gene regions. Aggregate genetic variation in circadian rhythm and melatonin pathways were significantly associated with the risk of prostate cancer in data combining GAME-ON and PLCO, after Bonferroni correction (ppathway < 0.00625). The two most significant genes were NPAS2 (pgene = 0.0062) and AANAT (pgene = 0.00078); the latter being significant after Bonferroni correction. For colorectal cancer, we observed a suggestive association with the circadian rhythm pathway in GAME-ON (ppathway = 0.021); this association was not confirmed in GECCO (ppathway = 0.76) or the combined data (ppathway = 0.17). No significant association was observed for ovarian and lung cancer. These findings support a potential role for circadian rhythm and melatonin pathways in prostate carcinogenesis. Further functional studies are needed to better understand the underlying biologic mechanisms.

PURPOSE: Improved survival rates from cancer have increased the need to understand the health-related problems of cancer treatment. We aimed to develop and validate the "Cancer Survivor Core Set" representing the most relevant health-related problems in adult cancer survivors using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). METHODS: First, a Delphi study was conducted to select ICF categories representing the most relevant health-related problems. There were three Dutch expert panels, one each for lung, colorectal, and breast cancer. Each panel comprised lay experts and professionals. The experts reached within- and between-panel consensus in two rounds (>/=70 % agreement). Second, a validation study was performed. Generic cancer survivorship questionnaires assessing health-related problems or quality of life among cancer survivors were selected. Items of selected questionnaires were linked to the best-fitting ICF category and to the selected ICF categories from the Delphi study, respectively. RESULTS: In total, 101 experts were included, of which 76 participated in both rounds, reaching consensus on 18 ICF categories. The Distress Thermometer and Problem List, the Impact of Cancer (v2), and the Quality of Life in Adult Cancer Survivors questionnaires were selected for the validation study, which led to the inclusion of one additional ICF category. CONCLUSIONS: The developed Cancer Survivor Core Set consisted of 19 ICF categories representing the most relevant health-related problems in adult cancer survivors: five from the "body functions and structures" component, eight from the "activities and participation" component, and six from the "environmental factors" component. HIGHLIGHTS: * Many adult cancer survivors have persistent health-related problems. * The Cancer Survivor Core Set was developed using the Delphi method. * The patients' perspectives were prioritized in this Delphi study * Content validity was confirmed by validated cancer survivorship questionnaires. * The Cancer Survivor Core Set may help optimize care for cancer survivors.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) of cancer cells is regarded as a strong determinant for cancer development and acquisition of metastatic potential of cancer cells. Because of its influence on tumorigenesis, the TME increasingly gained attention in research within the last years. Activated fibroblasts, so-called cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), which are the most prominent cell type in the stromal compartment, are responsible for the synthesis, deposition and remodeling of the extracellular matrix in tumor stroma thus creating a favorable microenvironment for cancer cells. Besides, they secrete paracrine factors, such as growth factors, chemokines and exosomes impacting on proliferation, invasion and cell signaling of cancer cells. Molecular mechanisms responsible for activation of fibroblasts and regulation of metastatic microenvironment are complex and not yet fully elucidated. However, mounting evidence suggests that miRNAs play a powerful role in the communication between cancer cells and TME. Via regulation of various signaling pathways, release of cytokines/growth factors or exosomes, miRNAs are able to regulate tumor promoting effects of CAFs. In this review, we describe baseline differences in miRNAs signatures between CAFs and normal fibroblasts and highlight the influence of miRNAs on cell signaling within CAFs.

Although metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a prognostic factor for cancer occurrence, the association of MetS and cancer mortality remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether MetS, components of MetS and C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with cancer mortality in women. A total of 400 cancer deaths, with 140 deaths from obesity-linked-cancers (OLCas), [breast (BCa), colorectal, pancreatic and endometrial], linked through the National Death Index, were identified from 10,104 eligible subjects aged >/=18 years. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for cancer mortality. MetS was associated with increased deaths for total cancer [HR = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04-1.70] and BCa [HR = 2.1, 95% CI, 1.09-4.11]. The risk of total cancer [HR = 1.7, 95% CI, 1.12-2.68], OLCas [HR = 2.1, 95% CI, 1.00-4.37] and BCa [HR = 3.8, 95% CI, 1.34-10.91] mortality was highest for women with all MetS components abnormal, compared to those without MetS. Linear associations of blood-pressure [HR = 2.5, 1.02-6.12, Quartile (Q) 4 vs Q1, p trend = 0.004] and blood-glucose [HR = 2.2, 1.04-4.60, Q4 vs. Q1, p trend = 0.04] with total-OLCas mortality were observed. A threefold increased risk of BCa mortality was observed for women with enlarged waist circumference, >/=100.9 cm, [HR = 3.5, 1.14-10.51, p trend = 0.008] and in those with increased blood glucose, >/=101 mg/dL, [HR = 3.2, 1.11-9.20, p trend = 0.03] compared to those in Q1. None of the components of MetS were associated with total-cancer mortality. CRP was not associated with cancer mortality. In conclusion, MetS is associated with total-cancer and breast-cancer mortality, with waist circumference, blood pressure and blood glucose as independent predictors of OLCas and BCa mortality.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of the current study was to evaluate the impact of radiotherapy (RT) among women aged >/= 70 years with T1-2N0 estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked data. METHODS: The study included 3432 women, 2850 of whom received and 582 of whom did not receive RT after breast-conserving surgery. Outcomes were estimated by the cumulative incidence method and compared with the Gray test. The Fine and Gray subdistribution hazard regression models were used to assess the impact of RT and other variables. RESULTS: Women who received RT were more commonly aged <75 years (42% vs 16%), had T1 tumors (78% vs 65%), ductal carcinoma histology (91% vs 88%), a Charlson-Deyo Comorbidity Index of 0 (41% vs 25%), and had received chemotherapy (29% vs 12%). The 5-year cumulative incidence of mastectomy and breast cancer-specific death for patients who received versus those did not receive adjuvant RT was 4.9% and 8.3% versus 10.8% and 24.1%, respectively (P<.001). On multivariable analysis, the omission of RT was found to be an independent predictor of an increased risk of mastectomy (hazard ratio, 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-3.49). Among women aged >/= 80 years or with T1N0 tumors, the mastectomy incidence with or without receipt of RT was 3.4% vs. 6.9%, and 5.3% vs 7.7%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The use of adjuvant RT after breast-conserving surgery in older women with T1-2N0 estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer is associated with a reduced incidence of future mastectomy and breast cancer death. The magnitude of benefit may be small for women aged >/=80 years or those with T1 tumors. Cancer 2016;122:3059-3068. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

Bone is the most common metastatic site for breast cancer. Estrogen-related-receptor alpha (ERRalpha) has been implicated in cancer cell invasiveness. Here, we established that ERRalpha promotes spontaneous metastatic dissemination of breast cancer cells from primary mammary tumors to the skeleton. We carried out cohort studies, pharmacological inhibition, gain-of-function analyses in vivo and cellular and molecular studies in vitro to identify new biomarkers in breast cancer metastases. Meta-analysis of human primary breast tumors revealed that high ERRalpha expression levels were associated with bone but not lung metastases. ERRalpha expression was also detected in circulating tumor cells from metastatic breast cancer patients. ERRalpha overexpression in murine 4T1 breast cancer cells promoted spontaneous bone micro-metastases formation when tumor cells were inoculated orthotopically, whereas lung metastases occurred irrespective of ERRalpha expression level. In vivo, Rank was identified as a target for ERRalpha. That was confirmed in vitro in Rankl stimulated tumor cell invasion, in mTOR/pS6K phosphorylation, by transactivation assay, ChIP and bioinformatics analyses. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of ERRalpha reduced primary tumor growth, bone micro-metastases formation and Rank expression in vitro and in vivo. Transcriptomic studies and meta-analysis confirmed a positive association between metastases and ERRalpha/RANK in breast cancer patients and also revealed a positive correlation between ERRalpha and BRCA1(mut) carriers. Taken together, our results reveal a novel ERRalpha/RANK axis by which ERRalpha in primary breast cancer promotes early dissemination of cancer cells to bone. These findings suggest that ERRalpha may be a useful therapeutic target to prevent bone metastases.

BACKGROUND: Many studies have shown a link between inflammation and cancer development. However, there are few studies regarding the correlation between Behcet disease (BD) and cancer. OBJECTIVES: To determine the overall cancer risk and risk for specific cancers in patients with BD. METHODS: Patients with BD (n = 14,137; mean age, 44.2 +/- 12.5 years; male patients, 32.4%) without known previous cancer were selected from the Korean National Health Insurance Database between 2007 and 2014. An age- and sex-matched control population of individuals without BD was randomly sampled at a ratio of 10:1. Both cohorts were followed for incident cancer until 2015. RESULTS: Overall, cancer was newly diagnosed in 451 patients with BD (3.19%) and 3975 controls (2.81%) during the follow-up period. Patients with BD showed a significantly higher risk for cancer compared with the controls (hazard ratio [HR], 1.134; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.029-1.25), leukemia (HR, 5.801; 95% CI, 3.24-10.385), lymphoma (HR, 2.584; 95% CI, 1.559-4.283), oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer (HR, 2.113; 95% CI, 1.102-4.052), thyroid cancer (HR, 1.256; 95% CI, 1.05-1.501), and prostate cancer (HR, 1.784; 95% CI, 1.141-2.791). LIMITATIONS: The treatment or severity of diseases in each individual was not examined. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with BD had a higher risk for overall cancer compared with controls without BD. Physicians should carefully monitor patients with BD for the potential development of malignancies.

BACKGROUND: The contribution of BRCA1 and BRCA2 to ovarian cancer in Japanese patients is still unclear. This study investigated the frequency of germline mutations in BRCA1/2 in Japanese patients with ovarian, peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer, regardless of their family histories, which were suggestive of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. METHODS: Ninety-five unselected women with ovarian cancer who were seen from 2013 to 2015 at Yamanashi Prefectural Central Hospital were enrolled. Analyses of BRCA1/2 gene mutations were performed with next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: Twelve of the 95 patients (12.6%), including 5 in the BRCA1 (5.3%) and 7 in the BRCA2 (7.4%), had deleterious mutations. Among the 36 cases with a family history, 6 (16.7%) were found to carry mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2. Notably, 6 of the 59 cases (10.2%) without a family history also had BRCA1/2 germline mutations. There was no statistical difference between the 2 groups (P = .36). The presence of mutations and their clinical relevance were studied. Mutation carriers were diagnosed at advanced stages (100% of positive cases among stage III or IV cases) and had poor prognostic histological subtypes (100% of positive cases had high-grade serous adenocarcinomas). CONCLUSIONS: In this unselected Japanese population, approximately 13% of the cases with ovarian cancer appeared to be associated with an inherited risk, regardless of a family history. This finding indicates that BRCA1/2 genetic testing should be performed for all patients with ovarian cancers.

BACKGROUND: Surgical biopsy of metastatic lesions followed by pathological confirmation for the investigation of biomarkers is occasionally proposed as an effective strategy in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. However, few reports have examined Ki-67 immunohistochemical expression in distant metastatic lesions of breast cancer patients. This study aimed to investigate the clinicopathological significance of subtypes and Ki-67 immunohistochemical expression in metastatic breast cancer lesions. METHODS: We retrospectively studied surgical specimens of primary breast cancer tumors and their corresponding metastatic lesions from patients (n = 68) who underwent surgery for primary breast cancer tumors between December 1977 and March 2013. Tissue microarrays were constructed using primary and metastatic lesions, and were stained with antibodies against estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, and Ki-67. We also examined the clinicopathological characteristics and outcome measures of patients with metastatic breast cancer using primary and paired metastatic lesions. RESULTS: Compared with the primary lesions, there was no significant difference in subtypes in the metastatic lesions according to metastatic sites. Metastatic lesions of the brain, viscera, and bone exhibited slightly higher levels of Ki-67 immunohistochemical expression compared with primary lesions. A Cox proportional hazards model using multivariate analysis demonstrated that high Ki-67 immunohistochemical expression in distant metastatic lesions was associated with poorer overall survival outcomes after biopsy of recurrence lesion (hazard ratio 2.307; 95% confidence interval 1.207-4.407, P = 0.011). CONCLUSIONS: High Ki-67 immunohistochemical expression levels in distant metastatic lesions were independently associated with poorer overall survival outcomes after biopsy of recurrence lesion in breast cancer patients.

PURPOSE: Numerous studies have demonstrated that breast cancer in young women (BCY) has unfavorable prognostic features and more unfavorable subtypes. However, few studies have evaluated the effect of subtype disparities on breast cancer prognosis by age, especially for BCY. We analyzed breast cancer mortality stratified by tumor subtype according to age among patients younger than 50 years. METHODS: Data from the Korean Breast Cancer Society Registry for patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer when aged less than 50 years between 2003 and 2010 were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: We identified 30,793 patients with breast cancer who were eligible for analysis. Of these, 793 (2.6%) were aged 20-29 and 8926 (28.8%) were aged 30-39. Median follow-up duration was 84 months. Mean age was 42.4 years. Patients in their 20s were more likely to have cancer of advanced stage and higher nuclear grade, present with lymphovascular invasion, and have unfavorable subtypes. Patients in the 20s group showed worse prognosis. In multivariate analysis for overall survival (OS), the hazard ratio (HR) for patients in the 20s group was higher than that for the 30s and 40s groups, and patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) showed higher HR than patients with HER-2 or luminal subtype (all p < 0.0001). When stratified by subtype, luminal subtype showed significantly worse prognosis in the 20s group than the 30s and 40s groups, whereas HER-2 and TNBC subtypes showed no significant difference. CONCLUSION: Patients in their 20s with breast cancer had unfavorable characteristics and worse prognosis than patients in their 30s and 40s. When stratified by tumor subtype, patients in their 20s with luminal subtype of breast cancer showed worse prognosis than older patients, whereas HER-2 and TNBC subtypes showed no significant differences.

Black women have a higher incidence of breast cancer before the age of 40 years, more severe disease at all ages, and an elevated mortality risk in comparison with white women. There is limited understanding of the contribution of social factors to these patterns. Elucidating the role of the social determinants of health in breast cancer disparities requires greater attention to how risk factors for breast cancer unfold over the lifecourse and to the complex ways in which socioeconomic status and racism shape exposure to psychosocial, physical, chemical, and other individual and community-level assaults that increase the risk of breast cancer. Research that takes seriously the social context in which black women live is also needed to maximize the opportunities to prevent breast cancer in this underserved group. Cancer 2016;122:2138-49.

BACKGROUND: Empowerment refers to an individual's feelings of being able to manage the challenges of the cancer experience and of having a sense of control over one's life. However, empowerment questionnaires that have been validated for the cancer setting are lacking. The objective of this study was to validate scales from the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ), which assesses the effects of health education programs among individuals with chronic conditions. The heiQ scales Social integration and support, Health service navigation, Constructive attitudes and approaches, Skill and technique acquisition, and Emotional distress were identified as key dimensions of empowerment for the cancer context. METHODS: Adults who were diagnosed with cancer < 3 years earlier were recruited from a population-based cancer registry and from the Canadian Cancer Society's information and peer-support programs. The 731 participants completed a mailed questionnaire, which included the heiQ scales, related constructs, and demographics. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach alpha values, and validity was determined using confirmatory factor analysis and scale correlations with related constructs (self-efficacy, intrusive thoughts about cancer, and mental and physical health). RESULTS: The hypothesized 5-factor model fit the data adequately (chi-square statistic, 528.17; degrees of freedom, 265; root mean square error of approximation, .04; non-normed fit index, .99; comparative fit index, 1.00; standardized root mean residual, .05). Factor loadings were high (23 of 25 were >/= .70), and the factor correlations indicated separate but related constructs. Cronbach alpha values ranged from .75 to .90. A priori hypotheses about the correlations between heiQ scales and related constructs all were supported. CONCLUSIONS: The current results support the validity of these 5 heiQ scales as generic measures of health-related empowerment in the cancer setting. These scales could fill an important gap in the measures currently available to evaluate proximal effects of support interventions.

BACKGROUND: Breast and cervical cancers represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality among women. The purpose of this study was to analyse the survival and time trends in two of the most common female cancers in the Regional Health District (RHD) of Barretos, Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: From 2000 through 2015, we calculated the breast and cervical cancer incidence and mortality rates per 100,000 women who were age-standardized to the world population. We obtained the time trends using the Joinpoint Regression software. We estimated the overall survival rates using the Kaplan-Meier methods. RESULTS: The age-standardized rates (ASR) for incidence of breast cancer increased annually, with an average annual percentage change (AAPC) of 4.3 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 2.4 to 6.3) for invasive breast cancer and 10.2 (95% CI: 6.1 to 14.5) for in situ breast cancer. The mortality rates for invasive breast cancer decreased with an AAPC of 0.2 (95% CI: -1.9 to 2.4). The ASR incidence of invasive cervical cancer showed an AAPC of - 1.9 (95% CI: -4.7 to 0.9). For in situ cases, the ASR showed an AAPC of 9.3 (95% CI: 3.3 to 15.7). The ASR mortality for cervical cancer showed an AAPC of - 5.3 (95% CI: -9.5 to - 0.8). The Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated 5-year overall survival rates of 74.3% for breast cancer and 70.7% for cervical cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of in situ and invasive breast cancer is increasing, while the mortality rates remain stable. We observed an increase in the incidence of in situ cervical cancer and a decrease in invasive incidence rates during the study period, and we noted that the cervical cancer mortality significantly declined during the study period.

PURPOSE: Consistent evidence indicates that cervical and breast cancer screening rates are low among socioeconomically deprived women. This study aimed to assess trends in cervical and breast cancer screening rates and to analyze socioeconomic inequalities among Korean women from 2005 to 2015. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Korean National Cancer Screening Survey, an annual nationwide cross-sectional survey, were utilized. A total of 19910 women were finally included for analysis. Inequalities in education and household income status were estimated by slope index of inequality (SII) and relative index of inequality (RII), along with calculation of annual percent changes (APCs), to show trends in cancer screening rates. RESULTS: Cervical and breast cancer screening rates increased from 54.8% in 2005 to 65.6% in 2015 and from 37.6% in 2005 to 61.2% in 2015, respectively. APCs in breast cancer screening rates were significant among women with higher levels of household income and education status. Inequalities by household income in cervical cancer screening uptake were observed with a pooled SII estimate of 10.6% (95% CI: 8.1 to 13.2) and RII of 1.4 (95% CI: 1.3 to 1.6). Income inequalities in breast cancer screening were shown to gradually increase over time with a pooled SII of 5.9% (95% CI: 2.9 to 9.0) and RII of 1.2 (95% CI: 0.9 to 1.3). Educational inequalities appeared to diminish over the study period for both cervical and breast cancer screening. CONCLUSION: Our study identified significant inequalities among socioeconomically deprived women in cervical and breast cancer screening in Korea. Especially, income-related inequalities were greater than education-related inequalities, and these were constant from 2005 to 2015 for both cervical and breast cancer screening.

BACKGROUND: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in Australia have been found to have poorer cancer survival than non-Aboriginal people. However, use of conventional relative survival analyses is limited due to a lack of life tables. This cohort study examined whether poorer survival persist after accounting for competing risks of death from other causes and disparities in cancer stage at diagnosis, for all cancers collectively and by cancer site. METHODS: People diagnosed in 2000-2008 were extracted from the population-based New South Wales Cancer Registry. Aboriginal status was multiply imputed for people with missing information (12.9%). Logistic regression models were used to compute odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 'advanced stage' at diagnosis (separately for distant and distant/regional stage). Survival was examined using competing risk regression to compute subhazard ratios (SHRs) with 95%CIs. RESULTS: Of the 301,356 cases, 2517 (0.84%) identified as Aboriginal (0.94% after imputation). After adjusting for age, sex, year of diagnosis, socio-economic status, remoteness, and cancer site Aboriginal peoples were more likely to be diagnosed with distant (OR 1.30, 95%CI 1.17-1.44) or distant/regional stage (OR 1.29, 95%CI 1.18-1.40) for all cancers collectively. This applied to cancers of the female breast, uterus, prostate, kidney, others (those not included in other categories) and cervix (when analyses were restricted to cases with known stages/known Aboriginal status). Aboriginal peoples had a higher hazard of death than non-Aboriginal people after accounting for competing risks from other causes of death, socio-demographic factors, stage and cancer site (SHR 1.40, 95%CI 1.31-1.50 for all cancers collectively). Consistent results applied to colorectal, lung, breast, prostate and other cancers. CONCLUSIONS: Aboriginal peoples with cancer have an elevated hazard of cancer death compared with non-Aboriginal people, after accounting for more advanced stage and competing causes of death. Further research is needed to determine reasons, including any contribution of co-morbidity, lifestyle factors and differentials in service access to help explain disparities.

Selective targeting of cancer cells over normal cells is a key objective of targeted therapy. However few approaches achieve true mechanistic selectivity resulting in debilitating side effects and dose limitation. In this work we describe the discovery of A131 (4a), a new agent with an unprecedented dual mechanism of action targeting both mitosis and autophagy. Compound 4a was first identified in a phenotypic screen in which HeLa cells treated with 4a manifested mitotic arrest along with formation of multiple vesicles. Further investigations showed that 4a causes an increase in mitotic marker pH3 and autophagy marker LC3. Importantly 4a induces cell death in cancer cells while sparing normal cells which regrow after 4a is removed. Dual activities against pH3 and LC3 markers are required for cancer cell selectivity. An extensive SAR investigation confirmed 4a as the optimal dual inhibitor with potency against a panel of 30 cancer cell lines (average antiproliferative GI50 1.5muM). In a mouse model of paclitaxel-resistant colon cancer, 4a showed 74% tumor growth inhibition when administered at a dose of 20mg/kg IP twice a day.

BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life measures are common in oncology research, trials, and practice. Spiritual well-being has emerged as an important aspect of health-related quality of life and the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being; The 12-item Spiritual Well-Being Scale (FACIT-Sp-12) is the most widely used measure of spiritual well-being among those with cancer. However, there is an absence of reference values with which to facilitate the interpretation of scores in research and clinical practice. The objective of the current study was to provide FACIT-Sp-12 reference values from a representative sample of adult cancer survivors. METHODS: As part of the American Cancer Society's Study of Cancer Survivors-II, a national cross-sectional study of cancer survivors (8864 survivors) completed questionnaires assessing demographic characteristics, clinical information, and the FACIT-Sp-12. Scores were calculated and summarized by FACIT-Sp-12 subscale and total scores across age, sex, race/ethnicity, time after treatment, and cancer type. RESULTS: Student t tests for independent samples found that women reported significantly higher FACIT-Sp-12 scores (P<.001). Analyses of variance found significant main effects for FACIT-Sp-12 scores by age (P<.01), race/ethnicity (P<.05), and cancer type (P<.001). Post hoc comparisons revealed that older adults (those aged 60-69 years and 70-79 years) and black non-Hispanic individuals reported the highest FACIT-Sp-12 scores compared with those aged 18 to 39 years (P<.05; Cohen d [an effect size used to indicate the standardized difference between 2 means], 0.20-0.50) and white non-Hispanic individuals (P<.05; Cohen d, 0.02-0.62), respectively. All other significant main effects were small in magnitude (effect size range, 0.001-0.032). CONCLUSIONS: These data will aid in the interpretation of the magnitude and meaning of FACIT-Sp-12 scores, and allow for comparisons of scores across studies.

Current studies have explored the correlation between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of pregnane X receptor (PXR) and cancer risk. However, the findings were conflicting. Hence, we performed a comprehensive review and meta-analysis for these researches to determine the effect of PXR polymorphisms on the risk of cancer. Eligible publications were collected based on a series of rigorous inclusion and exclusion criteria. In consequence, a total of eight case-control studies (from seven citations) covering 11143 cases and 12170 controls were involved in a meta-analysis of ten prevalent PXR SNPs (rs10504191 G/A, rs3814058 C/T, rs6785049 A/G, rs1464603 A/G, rs1523127 A/C, rs2276706 G/A, rs2276707 C/T, rs3732360 C/T, rs3814055 C/T, rs3814057 A/C). The correlations between PXR SNPs and cancer risk were estimated by odds ratios (ORs) with their 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). The findings demonstrated that rs3814058 polymorphism (CT compared with CC: pooled OR = 1.280, P=6.36E-05; TT compared with CC: pooled OR = 1.663, P=2.40E-04; dominant model: pooled OR = 1.382, P=2.58E-08; recessive model: pooled OR = 1.422, P=0.002; T compared with C: pooled OR = 1.292, P=6.35E-05) and rs3814057 polymorphism (AC compared with AA: pooled OR = 1.170, P=0.036; dominant model: pooled OR = 1.162, P=0.037) were associated with the risk of overall cancer. In stratified analyses, rs3814058 polymorphism was revealed to increase the cancer risk in lung cancer subgroup. In summary, this meta-analysis indicates that the rs3814057 and rs3814058 polymorphisms of PXR gene play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of cancer and may be novel biomarkers for cancer-forewarning in overall population or in some particular subgroups.

BACKGROUND: The role of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage II colon cancer remains to be elucidated and its use varies between patients and institutions. Currently, clinical guidelines suggest discussing adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with high-risk stage II disease in the absence of conclusive randomized controlled trial data. To further investigate this relationship, the objective of the current study was to determine whether an association exists between overall survival (OS) and adjuvant chemotherapy in patients stratified by age and pathological risk features. METHODS: Data from the National Cancer Data Base were analyzed for demographics, tumor characteristics, management, and survival of patients with stage II colon cancer who were diagnosed from 1998 to 2006 with survival information through 2011. Pearson Chi-square tests and binary logistic regression were used to analyze disease and demographic data. Survival analysis was performed with the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. Propensity score weighting was used to match cohorts. RESULTS: Among 153,110 patients with stage II colon cancer, predictors of receiving chemotherapy included age <65 years, male sex, nonwhite race, use of a community treatment facility, non-Medicare insurance, and diagnosis before 2004. Improved and clinically relevant OS was associated with the receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy in all patient subgroups regardless of high-risk tumor pathologic features (poor or undifferentiated histology, <12 lymph nodes evaluated, positive resection margins, or T4 histology), age, or chemotherapy regimen, even after adjustment for covariates and propensity score weighting (hazard ratio, 0.76; P<.001). There was no difference in survival noted between single and multiagent adjuvant chemotherapy regimens. CONCLUSIONS: In what to the authors' knowledge is the largest group of patients with stage II colon cancer evaluated to date, improved OS was found to be associated with adjuvant chemotherapy regardless of treatment regimen, patient age, or high-risk pathologic risk features.

PURPOSE: The number of young cancer survivors has increased over the past few decades due to improvement in treatment regimens, and understanding of long-term effects among the survivors has become even more important. Educational achievements and choice of educational fields were explored here. METHODS: Five-year cancer survivors born in Norway during 1965-1985 (diagnosed <19 years) were included in our analysis by linking Norwegian population-based registries. Cox regression was applied to study the educational attainment among survivors of central nervous system (CNS) tumours, those assumed to have received CNS-directed therapy, and other cancer survivors relative to the cancer-free population. Logistic regression was used to compare the choice of educational fields between the cancer survivors at undergraduate and graduate level and the cancer-free population. RESULTS: Overall, a lower proportion of the cancer survivors completed intermediate (67 vs. 70 %), undergraduate (31 vs. 35 %) and graduate education (7 vs. 9 %) compared with the cancer-free population. Deficits in completion of an educational level were mainly observed among survivors of CNS-tumours and those assumed to have received CNS-directed therapy. Choices of educational fields among cancer survivors were in general similar with the cancer-free population at both undergraduate and graduate levels. CONCLUSION: Survivors of CNS-tumours and those assumed to have received CNS-directed therapy were at increased risk for educational impairments compared with the cancer-free population. Choices of educational fields were in general similar. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Careful follow-up of the survivors of CNS-tumours and those assumed to have received CNS-directed therapy is important at each level of education.

BACKGROUND: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is well validated for tissue characterization of cardiac masses but has not been applied to study pattern and prognostic implications of cardiac metastases (CMETs) among patients with systemic cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS: The population consisted of 60 patients with stage IV cancer (32 patients with CMETs, 28 diagnosis-matched controls) undergoing CMR. CMET was defined as a discrete mass with vascular tissue properties on delayed enhancement CMR. CMET-positive patients and controls had similar clinical characteristics, cardiac geometry, and function (P=NS). Leading cancer types associated with CMET were sarcoma, melanoma, and gastrointestinal. Patients with CMETs had similar distribution of extracardiac metastatic disease compared with controls (organs involved: 3.4+/-2.0 versus 2.7+/-1.9, P=0.17). In 94% of patients with CMETs, there were metastases involving >/=1 extracardiac organ (66% lung involvement). CMET location varied (right ventricle 44%, right atrium 19%, left ventricle 28%, left atrium 9%, pericardial 25%); 22% of cases had multichamber involvement. Right-sided chamber involvement was common in hematologic/lymphatic spread (67%); pericardial involvement was common with direct spread (64%). Regarding tissue properties on delayed enhancement CMR, CMETs commonly (59%) demonstrated heterogeneous enhancement (41% diffuse enhancement). Heterogeneous lesions were larger and had increased border irregularity (P<0.05). Survival 6 months post-CMR was numerically lower among patients with CMETs (56% [95% CI 39-74%]) versus stage IV cancer-matched controls (68% [95% CI 50-86%]), although differences between groups were nonsignificant (P=0.42). CONCLUSIONS: CMETs vary regarding etiology, location, and tissue properties on CMR, highlighting need for comprehensive surveillance of cardiac involvement regardless of cancer origin. Prognosis remains poor with for patients with CMETs, albeit similar to that for stage IV cancer controls matched for cancer etiology.

BACKGROUND: Low income and uninsured individuals often have lower adherence to cancer screening for breast, cervical and colorectal cancer. Health fairs are a common community outreach strategy used to provide cancer-related health education and services. METHODS: This study was a process evaluation of seven health fairs focused on cancer screening across the U.S. We conducted key-informant interviews with the fair coordinator and conducted baseline and follow-up surveys with fair participants to describe characteristics of participants as well as their experiences. We collected baseline data with participants at the health fairs and telephone follow-up surveys 6 months following the fair. RESULTS: Attendance across the seven health fairs ranged from 41 to 212 participants. Most fairs provided group or individual education, print materials and cancer screening during the event. Overall, participants rated health fairs as very good and participants reported that the staff was knowledgeable and that they liked the materials distributed. After the fairs, about 60% of participants, who were reached at follow-up, had read the materials provided and had conversations with others about cancer screening, and 41% talked to their doctors about screening. Based on findings from evaluation including participant data and coordinator interviews, we describe 6 areas in planning for health fairs that may increase their effectiveness. These include: 1) use of a theoretical framework for health promotion to guide educational content and activities provided, 2) considering the community characteristics, 3) choosing a relevant setting, 4) promotion of the event, 5) considerations of the types of services to deliver, and 6) evaluation of the health fair. CONCLUSIONS: The events reported varied in reach and the participants represented diverse races and lower income populations overall. Most health fairs offered education, print materials and onsite cancer screening. Participants reported general satisfaction with these events and were motivated through their participation to read educational materials or discuss screening with providers. Public health professionals can benefit from this process evaluation and recommendations for designing and evaluating health fairs.

BACKGROUND: Childhood and adolescent cancers are uncommon, but they have important economic and health impacts on patients, families, and health care systems. Few studies have measured the economic burden of care for childhood and adolescent cancers. OBJECTIVES: To estimate costs of cancer care in population-based cohorts of children and adolescents from the public payer perspective. METHODS: We identified patients with cancer, aged 91 days to 19 years, diagnosed from 1995 to 2009 using cancer registry data, and matched each to three noncancer controls. Using linked administrative health care records, we estimated total and net resource-specific costs (in 2012 Canadian dollars) during 90 days prediagnosis and 1 year postdiagnosis. RESULTS: Children (</=14 years old) numbered 4,396: 36% had leukemia, 21% central nervous system tumors, 10% lymphoma, and 33% other cancers. Adolescents (15-19 years old) numbered 2,329: 28.9% had lymphoma. Bone and soft tissue sarcoma, germ cell tumor, and thyroid carcinoma each comprised 12% to 13%. Mean net prediagnosis costs were $5,810 and $1,127 and mean net postdiagnosis costs were $136,413 and $62,326 for children and adolescents, respectively; the highest were for leukemia ($157,764 for children and $172,034 for adolescents). In both cohorts, costs were much higher for patients who died within 1 year of diagnosis. Inpatient hospitalization represented 69% to 74% of postdiagnosis costs. CONCLUSIONS: Treating children with cancer is costly, more costly than treating adolescents or adults. Substantial survival gains in children mean that treatment may still be very cost-effective. Comprehensive age-specific population-based cost estimates are essential to reliably assess the cost-effectiveness of cancer care for children and adolescents, and measure health system performance.

BACKGROUND: It is estimated that a total of 120,000 new cancer cases in men and in women in more developed countries could be avoided if exposure to HPV was prevented. We used the nationwide pool of German population-based cancer registry data to estimate the burden of HPV-attributable cancer in this population for the year 2013. METHODS: Incident cases of cervical cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the anus, oropharynx (OP), as well as of the vulva, vagina and penis were classified as potentially HPV-associated and identified from the nationwide cancer registry data-pool. We calculated the incidence and proportions of cancer with potentially HPV-associated morphologies. Estimation of the HPV-attributable incidence was based on prevalence-estimates of viral DNA in tumor cells in the respective sites, as provided from the international literature. RESULTS: From the overall 15,936 incident cases of anogenital and OP cancers in 2013, 6239 female and 1358 male cancer cases were estimated to be attributable to HPV. The majority of HPV-attributable cases were contributed by cervical cancer (70.9% of female cancers) and oropharyngeal cancer (46.9% of male cancers). CONCLUSIONS: Even if most HPV-attributable cases were contributed by cervical cancer, anogenital cancer at sites other than the cervix, and oropharyngeal cancer substantially contribute to the burden of HPV-associated cancer. Our nationwide cancer registry data-analyses provide the baseline for long-term population-based monitoring of vaccination-effects on cancer incidence in Germany.

BACKGROUND: Evidence regarding the correlation between smoking and breast cancer among young women is mixed, and previous studies have not assessed whether smoking is associated differentially with risks of the major breast cancer subtypes. METHODS: This was a population-based, case-control study of 778 women with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancers and 182 women with ER-negative, progesterone receptor-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (triple-negative [TN]), invasive breast cancers ages 20 to 44 years who were diagnosed from 2004 to 2010 in the Seattle-Puget Sound metropolitan area. A control group of 938 cancer-free women also was included. Associations between various aspects of smoking history and the risks of ER-positive and TN breast cancer were assessed using polytomous logistic regression. RESULTS: Ever-smokers had a 1.3-fold increased risk (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.1-fold to 1.7-fold increased risk) of breast cancer overall; and, when stratified by cancer subtype, they had a 1.4-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.1-fold to 1.8-fold increased risk) of ER-positive breast cancer, but there was no elevation in their risk of TN disease (odds ratio, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7-1.6). Current/recent smokers with a >/=10 pack-year history of smoking had a 1.6-fold increased risk (95% CI, 1.1-fold to 2.4-fold increased risk) of ER-positive breast cancer but had no increase in their risk of TN breast cancer (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.5-1.9). CONCLUSIONS: The current results suggested that young women who are current/recent smokers with high pack-year histories may have an increased risk of ER-positive breast cancer but not TN breast cancer. Although this association was modest, the findings suggest that an increased risk of ER-positive breast cancer may be another health risk incurred by young women who smoke.

BACKGROUND: Favorable outcomes for human papillomavirus-associated oropharyngeal cancer have led to interest in identifying a subgroup of patients with the lowest risk of disease recurrence after therapy. De-intensification of therapy for this group may result in survival outcomes that are similar to those associated with current therapy but with less toxicity. To advance this effort, this study analyzed the outcomes of oropharyngeal cancer patients treated with or without systemic therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective study of patients with oropharyngeal cancer treated between 1985 and 2012. The criteria for inclusion were </=10 pack-years of cigarette smoking and stage III/IVA cancer limited to T1-3, N1-N2b, and T3N0 disease. A survival analysis was performed with the primary endpoint of progression-free survival (PFS). RESULTS: The cohort included 857 patients. Systemic therapy was given to 439 patients (51%). The median survival was 80 months. The 2-year PFS rate was 91%. When the analysis was limited to 324 patients irradiated without systemic therapy, the 2- and 5-year PFS rates were 90% and 85%, respectively. Furthermore, for these 324 patients, the 5-year PFS rates for T1, T2, and T3 disease were 90%, 83%, and 70%, respectively. The 5-year PFS rate for patients treated with systemic therapy for T3 disease was 77% (P = .07). CONCLUSIONS: According to the low-risk definition currently established in cooperative trials, the patients had a 2-year PFS rate approximating 90%. When patients who were treated with radiation alone were evaluated, no compromise was observed in this high rate of PFS, which is higher than the 2-year PFS thresholds used in current cooperative trials.

BACKGROUND: Given that continued smoking after a cancer diagnosis increases the risk of adverse health outcomes, patients with cancer are strongly advised to quit. Despite a current lack of evidence regarding their safety and effectiveness as a cessation tool, electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) are becoming increasingly popular. To guide oncologists' communication with their patients about E-cigarette use, this article provides what to the authors' knowledge is the first published clinical data regarding E-cigarette use and cessation outcomes among patients with cancer. METHODS: A total of 1074 participants included smokers (patients with cancer) who recently enrolled in a tobacco treatment program at a comprehensive cancer center. Standard demographic, tobacco use history, and follow-up cessation outcomes were assessed. RESULTS: A 3-fold increase in E-cigarette use was observed from 2012 to 2013 (10.6% vs 38.5%). E-cigarette users were more nicotine dependent than nonusers, had more prior quit attempts, and were more likely to be diagnosed with thoracic and head or neck cancers. Using a complete case analysis, E-cigarette users were as likely to be smoking at the time of follow-up as nonusers (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.7). Using an intention-to-treat analysis, E-cigarette users were twice as likely to be smoking at the time of follow-up as nonusers (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.3). CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of E-cigarette use observed is consistent with recent articles highlighting increased E-cigarette use in the general population. The current longitudinal findings raise doubts concerning the usefulness of E-cigarettes for facilitating smoking cessation among patients with cancer. Further research is needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of E-cigarettes as a cessation treatment for patients with cancer.

In the 3 decades from 1940 to 1970, the United States became the nucleus for research, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. The discovery of anticancer drugs, and the clinical demonstration that chemotherapy and radiation can cure cancer and have the ability to prevent recurrence of cancer, were incontrovertibly the most remarkable groundbreaking events. Consequently, the trend of less surgery and more multimodality therapy began. The introduction of radioautography, mammography, ultrasonography, computed tomography, Papanicolaou smear, and other novel laboratory tests furthered early detection of cancer and refined accurate diagnosis. The unequivocal linking of lung cancer to cigarette smoking made medical history. The delineation of the potential role of oncogenes adduced new thoughts about oncogenesis and cancer prevention, and pathologists finalized the classification and nosology of tumors. Finally, it is worth noting that although more advances were made in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of cancers than any other period in history, the overall mortality rate of patients with cancer remained high and unchanged.

BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine variations in delivery of several breast cancer processes of care that are correlated with lower mortality and disease recurrence, and to determine the extent to which hospital volume explains this variation. METHODS: Women who were diagnosed with stage I-III unilateral breast cancer between 2007 and 2011 were identified within the National Cancer Data Base. Multiple logistic regression models were developed to determine whether hospital volume was independently associated with each of 10 individual process of care measures addressing diagnosis and treatment, and 2 composite measures assessing appropriateness of systemic treatment (chemotherapy and hormonal therapy) and locoregional treatment (margin status and radiation therapy). RESULTS: Among 573,571 women treated at 1755 different hospitals, 38%, 51%, and 10% were treated at high-, medium-, and low-volume hospitals, respectively. On multivariate analysis controlling for patient sociodemographic characteristics, treatment year and geographic location, hospital volume was a significant predictor for cancer diagnosis by initial biopsy (medium volume: odds ratio [OR] = 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.05-1.25; high volume: OR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.14-1.49), negative surgical margins (medium volume: OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.06-1.24; high volume: OR = 1.28, 95% CI = 1.13-1.44), and appropriate locoregional treatment (medium volume: OR = 1.12, 95% CI = 1.07-1.17; high volume: OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.09-1.24). CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of breast cancer before initial surgery, negative surgical margins and appropriate use of radiation therapy may partially explain the volume-survival relationship. Dissemination of these processes of care to a broader group of hospitals could potentially improve the overall quality of care and outcomes of breast cancer survivors. Cancer 2017;123:957-66.

BACKGROUND: Standard biomarker testing of a single macroscopic disease site is unlikely to be sufficient because of tumor heterogeneity. A focus on examining global biomarker expression or activity, particularly in microscopic residual chemotherapy-resistant disease, is needed for the appropriate selection of targeted therapies. This study was aimed at establishing a technique for the assessment of biomarkers of ovarian cancer peritoneal spread. METHODS: An in-house developed fluorescent imaging device was used to detect the expression of the c-Met oncogene in ovarian cancer. A modified cyanine 5-tagged peptide, GE137, with a high in vitro affinity for the human c-Met protein, was tested in a panel of ovarian cancer cell lines. Finally, the feasibility of detecting submillimeter ovarian cancer cell peritoneal metastases in vivo was tested through the intravenous injection of GE137 into mice with tumor xenografts. RESULTS: Using optical imaging it was possible to detect c-Met expression in submillimeter peritoneal metastases that were freshly excised from a human high-grade serous ovarian cancer. GE137 selectively bound to the c-Met tyrosine kinase without activating survival signaling pathways (AKT or extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation) downstream of c-Met. GE137 specifically accumulated in SKOv3 ovarian cancer cells expressing c-Met via clathrin-mediated endocytosis and emitted a fluorescent signal that lasted for at least 8 hours in tumor xenografts in vivo with a sustained high signal-to-noise ratio. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that intraoperative optical imaging could provide a new paradigm for selecting cancer patients for appropriate targeted therapies, particularly after initial chemotherapy.

To assess whether timing of initial post-diagnosis cancer care differs between American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) and non-Hispanic White (NHW) patients, we accessed SEER-Medicare data for breast, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers (2001-2007). Medicare claims data were examined for initiation of cancer-directed treatment. Overall, AI/ANs experienced longer median times to starting treatment than NHWs (45 and 39 days, p &lt; .001) and lower rates of treatment initiation (HR[95%CI]: 0.86[0.79-0.93]). Differences were largest for prostate (HR: 0.80[0.71-0.89]) and smallest for breast cancer (HR: 0.96[0.83-1.11]). American Indians / Alaska Natives also had elevated odds of greater than 10 weeks between diagnosis and treatment compared with NHWs (OR[95% CI]: 1.37[1.16-1.63]), especially for prostate cancer (OR: 1.41[1.14-1.76]). Adjustment for comorbidity and socio-demographic factors attenuated associations except for prostate cancer. In this insured population, we observed evidence that AI/ANs start cancer therapy later than NHWs. The modest magnitude of delays suggests that they are unlikely to be a determinant of survival disparities.

BACKGROUND: Limited data exist about sleep quality for patients with advanced cancer in phase 1 clinical trials. Poor sleep quality is often not captured as an adverse event, and its association with fatigue, one of the most frequently reported adverse events, is not documented routinely. This article describes sleep quality and its relation with fatigue, symptom burden, and mood in patients recruited from an early-phase clinic for targeted therapy. METHODS: Sleep, fatigue, symptom burden, and mood were assessed with the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the Brief Fatigue Inventory, the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI), and the Brief Profile of Mood States, respectively; the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) was determined from medical records. RESULTS: The sample (n = 256) was 51.2% female, 90% had an ECOG PS of 0 or 1, and the mean age was 58 +/- 0.8 years. Poor sleepers (global PSQI score > 5) constituted 64% of the sample. In separate multiple regression models, poor sleepers had higher levels of fatigue (P < .001), symptom burden (P < .001), and overall mood disturbance (P < .001) than good sleepers. Also, compared with good sleepers, poor sleepers had greater fatigue-related and symptom-related interference with daily activities (all P values < .001). The MDASI disturbed-sleep item correlated well with the global PSQI score (Pearson's r = 0.679, P < .001), and this suggests its usefulness as a patient-reported outcome screener of sleep quality in early-phase clinical trials clinics. CONCLUSIONS: Poor sleep quality was a significant problem in the current study and was associated with greater fatigue, symptom burden, and mood disturbance. Sleep quality should be routinely assessed in patients with advanced cancer who are participating in early-phase clinical trials. Cancer 2016;122:3401-3409. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Whether biochemical recurrence (BR) is a significant predictive factor of mortality after definitive radiation therapy for prostate cancer remains unknown. The aim of the current study was to investigate the relation between BR and overall mortality (OAM) in high-risk prostate cancer patients who were treated with carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) and had long-term follow-up in 2 prospective trials. METHODS: In the 2 phase 2 clinical trials, which involved 466 prostate cancer patients who received 63.0 to 66.0 Gy of CIRT (relative biological effect) in 20 fractions between 2000 and 2007, 324 patients who were deemed to be at high risk on the basis of the modified D'Amico classification criteria and received CIRT along with androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) were examined. The OAM rate was adjusted for the ADT duration, and multivariate analyses using a Cox proportional hazards model were performed for OAM with BR as a time-dependent covariate. RESULTS: The median follow-up period was 107.4 months, and the 5- and 10-year OAM rates after adjustments for the ADT duration were 7.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.0%-9.4%) and 23.9% (95% CI, 16.4%-26.2%), respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that the presence of BR (hazard ratio, 2.82; 95% Cl, 1.57-5.08; P = .001) was one of the predictive factors for OAM. On the other hand, the duration of ADT had no impact on OAM. CONCLUSIONS: BR after CIRT combined with ADT is an independent predictive factor for OAM in high-risk prostate cancer patients. The results of this study could be applied to other high-dose radiation therapies. Cancer 2016;122:3225-31. (c) 2016 The Authors.

Register for new drugs in cancer care provides a picture of how the drugs are used in the daily clinical practice Today, an increasing number of cancer drugs are approved before traditional well-controlled phase 3 studies have been conducted and in many registration studies there is no participation of Swedish departments. This article describes the general experience of a caregiver initiated systematic follow-up of new cancer drugs that shows the possibility of obtaining a picture of the drug's use in routine care. From the register "New Pharmaceuticals in Cancer care", registrations from Stockholm-Gotland region are reported. The structure of the registry can be used with advantage in other therapeutic areas than cancer and can be supplemented with data from national and regional registers as well as quality registers including patient experiences. The knowledge is important to many actors in health care and can contribute to an evidence based, patient-safe and equal healthcare in accordance with current guidelines.

Diet, physical activity, and body weight have been shown to play an important role in cancer survivorship. The impact of each of these lifestyle factors differs slightly among cancer types, and adherence to recommended diet and physical activity guidelines has been associated with positive outcomes, including decrease in the risk of cancer recurrence and improvement of quality of life. Although there are compelling data that appropriate diet, physical activity, and body weight have beneficial effects in cancer survivorship, additional trials are needed to understand the relationship.

BACKGROUND: Cancer not only affects patients but also their caregivers. The objective of the current study was to assess the unmet needs of cancer caregivers and to identify possible predictors of their supportive care needs. METHODS: In a cross-sectional survey, 188 dyads of patients diagnosed with lung, urological, or gastrointestinal cancer and their primary caregivers were recruited. Caregivers were asked to complete the Supportive Care Needs Survey self-report questionnaire (for partners and caregivers); patients completed the corresponding questionnaire. Both groups provided information regarding their distress (National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer), anxiety, and depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-4). Clinical characteristics were obtained from medical records. RESULTS: The mean age of the caregivers was 57.8 years. Approximately 72.3% were female. Patients had an average age of 62.5 years, with 33.0% being male. Caregivers were more distressed (P<.01) and exhibited higher anxiety scores (P<.01) compared with patients. Approximately 14.4% of caregivers reported no unmet need and 43.6% had at least 10 needs that were unmet. Main caregiver concerns were regarding health care service and information needs followed by emotional and psychological needs. To some degree, unmet needs in patients and caregivers' anxiety predicted unmet caregiver needs. Sociodemographic and clinical variables were not found to be significant predictors. CONCLUSIONS: A substantial percentage of caregivers have unmet needs for support, mainly with regard to fears concerning the patient's condition, receiving disease-related information, and emotional support for themselves. Prediction of unmet needs in caregivers from other clinical and psychological variables was rather poor. Therefore, by means of the frequency and disparity of caregivers unmet needs, they should be systematically assessed to direct specific offers.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline-adherent initiation of postoperative radiation therapy (PORT) and different time-to-PORT intervals on the overall survival (OS) of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was reviewed for the period of 2006-2014, and patients with HNSCC undergoing surgery and PORT were identified. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, Cox regression analysis, and propensity score matching were used to determine the effects of initiating PORT within 6 weeks of surgery and different time-to-PORT intervals on survival. RESULTS: This study included 41,291 patients. After adjustments for covariates, starting PORT >6 weeks postoperatively was associated with decreased OS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.13; 99% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-1.19). This finding remained in the propensity score-matched subset (hazard ratio, 1.21; 99% CI, 1.15-1.28). In comparison with starting PORT 5 to 6 weeks postoperatively, initiating PORT earlier was not associated with improved survival (aHR for </= 4 weeks, 0.93; 99% CI, 0.85-1.02; aHR for 4-5 weeks, 0.92; 99% CI, 0.84-1.01). Increasing durations of delay beyond 7 weeks were associated with small, progressive survival decrements (aHR, 1.09, 1.10, and 1.12 for 7-8, 8-10, and >10 weeks, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Nonadherence to NCCN guidelines for initiating PORT within 6 weeks of surgery was associated with decreased survival. There was no survival benefit to initiating PORT earlier within the recommended 6-week timeframe. Increasing durations of delay beyond 7 weeks were associated with small, progressive survival decrements. Cancer 2017;123:4841-50. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

The platinum-free interval is the most important predictive factor of a response to subsequent lines of chemotherapy and the most important prognostic factor for progression-free and overall survival in patients with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer. A nonplatinum regimen is generally considered the most appropriate approach when the disease recurs very early after the end of chemotherapy, whereas platinum-based chemotherapy is usually adopted when the platinum-free interval exceeds 12 months. However, the therapeutic management of patients with intermediate sensitivity (ie, when the relapse occurs between 6 and 12 months) remains debatable. Preclinical and clinical data suggest that the extension of platinum-free interval (using a nonplatinum-based regimen) might restore platinum sensitivity, thus allowing survival improvement. The objective of this review was to critically analyze preclinical and clinical evidences supporting this hypothesis. Cancer 2017;123:3450-9. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Cachexia is a multisystem syndrome characterized by weight loss, anorexia, loss of muscle mass, systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and functional decline. Management of cachexia involves addressing multiple underlying biological mechanisms. Previous review on pharmacological management of cancer cachexia identified progestins and corticosteroids as effective agents for treatment of cachexia. However, to date no consensus exists on a single effective or standard treatment for management of cachexia. The aim of this systematic review is to determine the effectiveness of pharmacological treatments used to manage cachexia among adult cancer patients. METHODS: We performed literature searches of PubMed (NLM), Embase (Ovid), and Medline(Ovid) to identify clinical trials focused on pharmacological management of cancer cachexia among adult cancer patients from 2004 to 2018. Three reviewers screened a random selection of abstracts to measure for interrater reliability. After this step, each screener screened two-thirds of all abstracts and 177 studies were identified for full text review. The primary outcome was impact of pharmacological management on change in either weight or lean body mass in cancer patients. RESULTS: We identified 19 articles (representing 20 RCTs) that focused on pharmacological management of cancer cachexia. Agents showing promising results included Anamorelin and Enobosarm. Anamorelin at 50 or 100 mg per day for 12 weeks showed a consistent benefit across all studies and resulted in significant improvement in weight as compared to baseline among cancer patients. Enobosarm at 1 and 3 mg per day was also effective in improving lean body mass and QOL symptoms among advancer stage cancer patients. Finally, use of combination agents provide evidence for targeting multiple pathways underlying cachexia mechanism to achieve maximum benefit. No agents showed functional improvement in cancer patients. CONCLUSION: Anamorelin as a single agent shows promising results in improving cachexia related weight loss among cancer patients. Further research on combination therapies may be helpful to address critical gaps in cachexia management.

Thyroid hormones play important roles in regulating normal metabolism, development, and growth. They also stimulate cancer cell proliferation. Their metabolic and developmental effects and growth effects in normal tissues are mediated primarily by nuclear hormone receptors. A cell surface receptor for the hormone on integrin [alpha]vbeta3 is the initiation site for effects on tumor cells. Clinical hypothyroidism may retard cancer growth, and hyperthyroidism was recently linked to the prevalence of certain cancers. Local levels of thyroid hormones are controlled through activation and deactivation of iodothyronine deiodinases in different organs. The relative activities of different deiodinases that exist in tissues or organs also affect the progression and development of specific types of cancers. In this review, the effects of thyroid hormone on signaling pathways in breast, brain, liver, thyroid, and colon cancers are discussed. The importance of nuclear thyroid hormone receptor isoforms and of the hormone receptor on the extracellular domain of integrin [alpha]vbeta3 as potential cancer risk factors and therapeutic targets are addressed. We analyze the intracellular signaling pathways activated by thyroid hormones in cancer progression in hyperthyroidism or at physiological concentrations in the euthyroid state. Determining how to utilize the deaminated thyroid hormone analog (tetrac), and its nanoparticulate derivative to reduce risks of cancer progression, enhance therapeutic outcomes, and prevent cancer recurrence is also deliberated.

BACKGROUND: Clinical trials in lung cancer increasingly require patients to provide fresh tumor tissue as a prerequisite to enrollment. The effects of this requirement on enrollment rates, enrollment durations, and patient selection have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed data generated by patients who consented to 1 or more interventional lung cancer clinical trials at the University of California-Los Angeles Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center between January 2013 and December 2014. Trials were considered to require a biopsy when enrollment was conditional on the procurement of tissue without intervening therapy between procurement and enrollment. RESULTS: In total, 311 patients underwent 368 screening incidents for 1 or more of 19 trials. Trials that required a new biopsy had a longer median screening duration (34 vs 14 days) than trials that did not require a biopsy (P < .001). Trials that required a biopsy had a greater screen failure rate (49.1% vs 26.5%; P < .001), which was largely driven by patients who did not undergo the required biopsy or lacked the required biomarker. Worsening performance status led to the majority of screen failures (56.5%) among biomarker-eligible patients. CONCLUSIONS: Although the scientific benefits of obtaining a new biopsy and requiring specific results for trial enrollment are clear, these requirements lead to a lengthening of the screening period, which, in some patients, is associated with clinical decline before enrollment. Implications for the interpretation of data from studies of this design should be explored. Cancer 2017;123:4800-7. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Complex surgical procedures such as esophagectomy and gastrectomy for cancer are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to evaluate trends in postoperative morbidity, mortality, and associated failure-to-rescue (FTR), in patients who underwent a potentially curative resection for esophageal or gastric cancer in the Netherlands, and to investigate differences between the two groups. METHODS: All patients with esophageal or gastric cancer who underwent a potentially curative resection, registered in the Dutch Upper GI Cancer Audit (DUCA) between 2011 and 2014, were included. Primary outcomes were (major) postoperative complications, postoperative mortality and FTR. To investigate groups' effect on the outcomes of interest a mixed model was used. RESULTS: Overall, 2644 patients with esophageal cancer and 1584 patients with gastric cancer were included in this study. In patients with gastric cancer, postoperative mortality (7.7% in 2011 vs. 3.8% in 2014) and FTR (38% in 2011 and 19% in 2014) decreased significantly over the years. The adjusted risk of developing a major postoperative complication was lower (OR 0.54; 95% CI 0.42-0.70), but the risk of FTR was higher (OR 1.85; 95% CI 1.05-3.27) in patients with gastric cancer compared to patients with esophageal cancer. CONCLUSION: Once a postoperative complication occurred, patients with gastric cancer were more likely to die compared to patients with esophageal cancer. Underlying mechanisms like patient selection, and differences in structure and organization of care should be investigated. Next to morbidity and mortality, failure-to-rescue should be considered as an important outcome measure after esophagogastric cancer resections.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is believed to arise through the perturbation of pathways and the order of pathway perturbation events can enhance understanding and evaluation of carcinogenicity. This order has not been examined so far, and this study aimed to fill this gap by attempting to gather evidence on the potential temporal sequence of events in carcinogenesis. DESIGN: The methodology followed was to discuss first the temporal sequence of hallmarks of cancer from the point of view of pathological specimens of cancer (essentially branched mutations) and then to consider the hallmarks of cancer that one well-known carcinogen, benzo(a)pyrene, can modify. RESULTS: Even though the sequential order of driving genetic alterations can vary between and within tumours, the main cancer pathways affected are almost ubiquitous and follow a generally common sequence: resisting cell death, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, sustained proliferation, deregulated energetics, replicative immortality and activation of invasion and metastasis. The first 3 hallmarks can be regarded as almost simultaneous while angiogenesis and avoiding immune destruction are perhaps the only hallmarks with a varying position in the above sequence. CONCLUSIONS: Our review of hallmarks of cancer and their temporal sequence, based on mutational spectra in biopsies from different cancer sites, allowed us to propose a hypothetical temporal sequence of the hallmarks. This sequence can add molecular support to the evaluation of an agent as a carcinogen as it can be used as a conceptual framework for organising and evaluating the strength of existing evidence.

BACKGROUND: Medical treatment for breast cancer is associated with substantial toxicity and patient burden. There is less known about the impact of surgical complications. Understanding this impact could provide important information for patients when they are considering surgical options. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2009, the UK National Mastectomy and Breast Reconstruction Audit recorded surgical complications for a prospective cohort of 17,844 women treated for breast cancer at 270 hospitals; 6405 of these women were surveyed about their quality of life 18 months after surgery. Breast appearance, emotional well-being, and physical well-being were quantified on 0- to 100-point scales. Linear multiple regression models, controlling for a range of baseline prognostic factors, were used to compare the scores of patients who had complications with the scores of those who did not. RESULTS: The overall complication rate was 10.2%. Complications were associated with little or no impairment in women undergoing mastectomy without reconstruction or with delayed reconstruction. The association was much larger for flap-related complications suffered during immediate reconstruction. The breast-appearance scores (adjusted mean difference, -23.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], -31.0 to -16.6) and emotional well-being scores (adjusted mean difference, -14.0; 95% CI, -22.0 to -6.0) of these patients were much lower than those of any other patient group. Implant-related complications were not associated with a lower quality of life in any surgical group. CONCLUSIONS: There is a strong case for prospectively collecting flap-complication rates at the surgeon and surgical unit level and for allowing patients to access these data when they make choices about their breast cancer surgery.

OBJECTIVE: In the 10 most common primary types with bone metastases, we aimed to examine survival, further stratifying on bone metastases only or with additional synchronous metastases. METHODS: We included all patients aged 18 years and older with incident hospital diagnosis of solid cancer between 1994 and 2010, subsequently diagnosed with BM until 2012. We followed patients from date of bone metastasis diagnosis until death, emigration or 31 December 2012, whichever came first. We computed 1-year, 3-year and 5-year survival (%) and the corresponding 95% CIs stratified on primary cancer type. Comparing patients with bone metastasis only and patients with other synchronous metastases, we estimated crude and adjusted HRs and corresponding 95% CI for mortality. RESULTS: We included 17 251 patients with bone metastasis. The most common primary cancer types with bone metastasis were prostate (34%), breast (22%) and lung (20%). One-year survival after bone metastasis diagnosis was lowest in patients with lung cancer (10%, 95% CI 9% to 11%) and highest in patients with breast cancer (51%, 50% to 53%). At 5 years of follow-up, only patients with breast cancer had over 10% survival (13%, 11% to 14%). The risk of mortality was increased for the majority of cancer types among patients with bone and synchronous metastases compared with bone only (adjusted relative risk 1.29-1.57), except for cervix, ovarian and bladder cancer. CONCLUSIONS: While patients with bone metastases after most primary cancers have poor survival, one of ten patients with bone metastasis from breast cancer survived 5 years.

BACKGROUND: Few previous studies investigating depression before the diagnosis of breast cancer and breast cancer-specific mortality have examined depression measured at more than 1 time point. This study investigated the effect of depression (combining depressive symptoms alone with antidepressant use) measured at 2 time points before the diagnosis of breast cancer on all-cause mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality among older postmenopausal women. METHODS: A large prospective cohort, the Women's Health Initiative, was used. The study included 3095 women with incident breast cancer who had measures of depressive symptoms and antidepressant use before their diagnosis at the baseline and at year 3. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) between depression at the baseline, depression at year 3, and combinations of depression at these time points and all-cause mortality and breast cancer-specific mortality. RESULTS: Depression at year 3 before a breast cancer diagnosis was associated with higher all-cause mortality after adjustments for multiple covariates (HR, 1.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.78). There was no statistically significant association of baseline depression and all-cause mortality or breast cancer-specific mortality whether or not depression was also present at year 3. In women with late-stage (regional- or distant-stage) breast cancer, newly developed depression at year 3 was significantly associated with both all-cause mortality (HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.13-3.56) and breast cancer-specific mortality (HR, 2.42; 95% CI, 1.24-4.70). CONCLUSIONS: Women with newly developed depression before the diagnosis of breast cancer had a modestly but significantly increased risk for death from any cause and for death from breast cancer at a late stage.

BACKGROUND: Clinical trials have established surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) as the standard management for stage III colon cancer; however, the extent to which these results apply to elderly patients in routine practice is unclear. This article describes the management and outcomes of elderly patients with stage III colon cancer. METHODS: All cases of surgically resected colon cancer from 2002 to 2008 were identified with the population-based Ontario Cancer Registry. Pathology reports were obtained for a random sample (25% of all cases); those with stage III disease constituted the study population. The utilization of ACT, cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) in elderly patients (>/=70 years) and nonelderly patients (<70 years) were compared. RESULTS: The study population included 2920 patients, and 1521 (52%) were elderly. The 30- and 90-day mortality rates increased with advanced age: <70 years, 2% and 5%; 70 to 74 years, 3% and 7%; 75 to 79 years, 5% and 8%, and >/=80 years, 9% and 16% (P < .001). ACT was delivered to 48% of elderly patients and to 81% of younger patients (P < .001). Factors independently associated with ACT utilization among the elderly were a younger age (P < .001), male sex (P = .041), and no comorbidities (P = .001). Among elderly patients, ACT was associated with improved CSS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.60-0.88) and OS (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.60-0.83); however, the magnitude of the benefit was smaller for elderly patients than younger patients (HR for CSS, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.42-0.67; HR for OS 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45-0.69). CONCLUSIONS: Half of elderly patients with stage III colon cancer do not receive ACT. Although the effect size is smaller than that in younger patients, ACT is associated with improved long-term survival. Cancer 2017;123:2840-49. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to report on cancer incidence and mortality for the year 2018 to estimate Korea's current cancer burden. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer incidence data from 1999 to 2015 were obtained from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, and cancer mortality data from 1993 to 2016 were acquired from Statistics Korea. Cancer incidence and mortality were projected by fitting a linear regression model to observed age-specific cancer rates against observed years, then multiplying the projected age-specific rates by the age-specific population. The Joinpoint regression model was used to determine at which year the linear trend changed significantly, we only used the data of the latest trend. RESULTS: A total of 204,909 new cancer cases and 82,155 cancer deaths are expected to occur in Korea in 2018. The most common cancer sites were lung, followed by stomach, colorectal, breast and liver. These five cancers represent half of the overall burden of cancer in Korea. For mortality, the most common sites were lung cancer, followed by liver, colorectal, stomach and pancreas. CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of all cancer in Korea are estimated to decrease gradually, mainly due to decrease of thyroid cancer. These up-to-date estimates of the cancer burden in Korea could be an important resource for planning and evaluation of cancer-control programs.

BACKGROUND: Over two-thirds of the world's cancer deaths occur in economically developing countries; however, the societal costs of cancer have rarely been assessed in these settings. Our aim was to estimate the value of productivity lost in 2012 due to cancer-related premature mortality in the major developing economies of Brazil, the Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). METHODS: We applied an incidence-based method using the human capital approach. We used annual adult cancer deaths from GLOBOCAN2012 to estimate the years of productive life lost between cancer death and pensionable age in each country, valued using national and international data for wages, and workforce statistics. Sensitivity analyses examined various methodological assumptions. RESULTS: The total cost of lost productivity due to premature cancer mortality in the BRICS countries in 2012 was $46.3 billion, representing 0.33% of their combined gross domestic product. The largest total productivity loss was in China ($28 billion), while South Africa had the highest cost per cancer death ($101,000). Total productivity losses were greatest for lung cancer in Brazil, the Russian Federation and South Africa; liver cancer in China; and lip and oral cavity cancers in India. CONCLUSION: Locally-tailored strategies are required to reduce the economic burden of cancer in developing economies. Focussing on tobacco control, vaccination programs and cancer screening, combined with access to adequate treatment, could yield significant gains for both public health and economic performance of the BRICS countries.

Deciding when to stop cancer screening in older adults is a complex challenge that involves multiple factors: individual health status and life expectancy; risks and benefits of screening, which vary with age and comorbidity; and individual preferences and values. This article examines current cancer screening practices and reviews the risks and benefits of cancer screening for colorectal, breast, lung, prostate, and cervical cancer, particularly in older individuals and those with multiple comorbidities. Tools for estimating life expectancy are reviewed, and a practical framework is presented to guide discussions on when the harms of screening likely outweigh the benefits.

Despite sharp increases in spending on cancer treatment since 1970 in the United States compared to Western Europe, US cancer mortality rates have decreased only modestly. This has raised questions about the additional value of US cancer care derived from this additional spending. We calculated the number of US cancer deaths averted, compared to the situation in Western Europe, between 1982 and 2010 for twelve cancer types. We also assessed the value of US cancer care, compared to that in Western Europe, by estimating the ratio of additional spending on cancer to the number of quality-adjusted life-years saved. Compared to Western Europe, for three of the four costliest US cancers-breast, colorectal, and prostate-there were approximately 67,000, 265,000, and 60,000 averted US deaths, respectively, and for lung cancer there were roughly 1,120,000 excess deaths in the study period. The ratio of incremental cost to quality-adjusted life-years saved equaled $402,000 for breast cancer, $110,000 for colorectal cancer, and $1,979,000 for prostate cancer-amounts that exceed most accepted thresholds for cost-effective medical care. The United States lost quality-adjusted life-years despite additional spending for lung cancer: -$19,000 per quality-adjusted life-year saved. Our results suggest that cancer care in the United States may provide less value than corresponding cancer care in Western Europe for many leading cancers.

PURPOSE: In this review, we highlight the current concepts and discuss some of the current challenges and future prospects in cancer therapy. We frequently use the example of lung cancer. METHODS: We conducted a nonsystematic PubMed search, selecting the most comprehensive and relevant research articles, clinical trials, translational papers, and review articles on precision oncology and immuno-oncology. Papers were prioritized and selected based on their originality and potential clinical applicability. FINDINGS: Two major revolutions have changed cancer treatment paradigms in the past few years: targeting actionable alterations in oncogene-driven cancers and immuno-oncology. Important challenges are still ongoing in both fields of cancer therapy. On the one hand, druggable genomic alterations are diverse and represent only small subsets of patients in certain tumor types, which limits testing their clinical impact in biomarker-driven clinical trials. Next-generation sequencing technologies are increasingly being implemented for molecular prescreening in clinical research, but issues regarding clinical interpretation of large genomic data make their wide clinical use difficult. Further, dealing with tumor heterogeneity and acquired resistance is probably the main limitation for the success of precision oncology. On the other hand, long-term survival benefits with immune checkpoint inhibitors (anti-programmed death cell protein-1/programmed death cell ligand-1[PD-1/L1] and anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 monoclonal antibodies) are restricted to a minority of patients, and no predictive markers are yet robustly validated that could help us recognize these subsets and optimize treatment delivery and selection. To achieve long-term survival benefits, drug combinations targeting several molecular alterations or cancer hallmarks might be needed. This will probably be one of the most challenging but promising precision cancer treatment strategies in the future. IMPLICATIONS: Targeting single molecular abnormalities or cancer pathways has achieved good clinical responses that have modestly affected survival in some cancers. However, this approach to cancer treatment is still reductionist, and many challenges need to be met to improve treatment outcomes with our patients.

BACKGROUND: Few population-based studies have examined the association between health insurance status and breast cancer stage at diagnosis and survival. The degree to which sociodemographic characteristics explain this association is also unclear. This study examined associations between insurance status and sociodemographic characteristics and stage at diagnosis and survival. METHODS: Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results 18 registries database, we identified 52,048 women aged 18 to 64 years who were diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 and 2008. Associations between insurance status and sociodemographic variables and stage at diagnosis and survival were examined with logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression models to calculate adjusted odds ratios (ORs), hazard ratios (HRs), and associated confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The odds of a later stage breast cancer diagnosis were increased in women with Medicaid (OR, 2.36; 95% CI, 2.19-2.55) and no insurance (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 2.29-3.04) versus private insurance, in women who had reported black race (OR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.09-1.28) versus white race, in women who were unmarried (OR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.18-1.33) versus married at diagnosis, and in women who were 18 to 39 years old (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.18-1.41) versus 40 to 64 years old at diagnosis. The hazard of breast cancer death was increased in association with Medicaid (HR, 1.40; 95% CI, 1.30-1.51) and no insurance (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.41-1.84) versus private insurance, with reported black race (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.29-1.50) versus reported white race, and with being unmarried (HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.12-1.27) versus being married. CONCLUSIONS: Insurance status at diagnosis and sociodemographic factors are associated with breast cancer mortality. Factors underlying these associations warrant further study.

BACKGROUND: The authors determined the impact of postmastectomy radiotherapy (PMRT) on overall survival (OS) among patients with pT3N0M0 breast cancer in the National Cancer Data Base. METHODS: A total of 3437 patients with pT3N0M0 breast cancer who initially were treated with mastectomy between 2003 and 2011 were identified. Of these women, 1644 (47.8%) received PMRT (67% treated with chest wall RT alone and 33% treated with chest wall and regional lymph node irradiation). Univariable and multivariable analyses were conducted to identify characteristics associated with PMRT and OS. In addition, propensity score matching and interaction effect testing also were performed. RESULTS: PMRT was associated with age <40 years, private insurance coverage, treatment facility location within 10 miles of the patient's home zip code, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score of 0, tumor size >/=7 cm, and treatment with chemotherapy or hormone therapy (all P<.05). PMRT was associated with improved 5-year OS (86.3% for patients treated with PMRT vs 66.4% for patients not treated with PMRT; P<.01). In addition to PMRT (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.59-0.87 [P<.01]), age </=50 years, treatment at an academic/research program, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score of 0, tumor size <7 cm, chemotherapy receipt, and hormone therapy receipt were associated with improved OS on multivariable analyses (all P<.05). Interaction testing found that PMRT improved OS independent of age, facility type, Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score, tumor grade and size, surgical margin status, and receipt of chemotherapy or hormone therapy (all P>.1). Finally, propensity score matching analysis confirmed the impact of PMRT on OS (P = .02). It is interesting to note that regional lymph node irradiation did not improve OS versus chest wall RT alone (P = .09). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with pT3N0M0 breast cancer in the National Cancer Data Base, PMRT was found to be associated with improved OS regardless of surgical margin status, tumor size, and receipt of systemic therapy.

Multiple advisory groups now recommend that high-risk smokers be screened for lung cancer by low-dose computed tomography. Given that the development of lung cancer screening programs will face many of the same issues that have challenged other cancer screening programs, the National Cancer Institute-funded Population-based Research Optimizing Screening through Personalized Regimens (PROSPR) consortium was used to identify lessons learned from the implementation of breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening that should inform the introduction of lung cancer screening. These lessons include the importance of developing systems for identifying and recruiting eligible individuals in primary care, ensuring that screening centers are qualified and performance is monitored, creating clear communication standards for reporting screening results to referring physicians and patients, ensuring follow-up is available for individuals with abnormal test results, avoiding overscreening, remembering primary prevention, and leveraging advances in cancer genetics and immunology. Overall, this experience emphasizes that effective cancer screening is a multistep activity that requires robust strategies to initiate, report, follow up, and track each step as well as a dynamic and ongoing oversight process to revise current screening practices as new evidence regarding screening is created, new screening technologies are developed, new biological markers are identified, and new approaches to health care delivery are disseminated.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer screening with annual chest computed tomography (CT) is recommended for current and former smokers with a >/=30-pack-year smoking history. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of developing lung cancer and may benefit from screening at lower pack-year thresholds. METHODS: We used a previously validated simulation model to compare the health benefits of lung cancer screening in current and former smokers ages 55-80 with >/=30 pack-years with hypothetical programs using lower pack-year thresholds for individuals with COPD (>/=20, >/=10, and >/=1 pack-years). Calibration targets for COPD prevalence and associated lung cancer risk were derived using the Framingham Offspring Study limited data set. We performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the stability of results across different rates of adherence to screening, increased competing mortality risk from COPD, and increased surgical ineligibility in individuals with COPD. The primary outcome was projected life expectancy. RESULTS: Programs using lower pack-year thresholds for individuals with COPD yielded the highest life expectancy gains for a given number of screens. Highest life expectancy was achieved when lowering the pack-year threshold to >/=1 pack-year for individuals with COPD, which dominated all other screening strategies. These results were stable across different adherence rates to screening and increases in competing mortality risk for COPD and surgical ineligibility. CONCLUSIONS: Current and former smokers with COPD may disproportionately benefit from lung cancer screening. A lower pack-year threshold for screening eligibility may benefit this high-risk patient population.

BACKGROUND: The increasing epidemic proportions of diabetes mellitus (DM) are a major cause of premature illness and death. However, whether DM confers the same excess risk of gastrointestinal cancer for women as it does for men remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to estimate the relation between DM and gastrointestinal cancer in women compared with men after accounting for other major risk factors based on cohort studies. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of cohort studies published through May 2017 from PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Studies with cohort designs were stratified by sex and reported the relation between DM and esophageal cancer (EC), gastric cancer (GC), colorectal cancer (CRC), colon cancer (CC), rectal cancer (RC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or pancreatic cancer (PC) risk. The ratio of relative risk (RRR) between men and women was employed to measure the sex differences in the relation between DM and gastrointestinal cancer with a random effects model with inverse variance weighting. RESULTS: We included 38 cohort studies reporting data on 18,060,698 individuals. The pooled RRR indicated DM women was associated with an increased risk of GC (RRR: 1.14; 95%CI: 1.06-1.22; p < 0.001), while the risk of HCC was lower (RRR: 0.88; 95%CI: 0.79-0.99; p = 0.031) as compared with DM men. Further, there was no evidence of sex differences in the RRR between participants who had DM compared with those without DM for EC (p = 0.068), CRC (p = 0.618), and PC (p = 0.976). In addition, the pooled RRR showed a statistically significant association between DM and the risk of CC in women compared with men (RRR: 0.93; 95%CI: 0.86-1.00; p = 0.050), and there was no evidence of sex differences for RC among participants with DM compared to those without DM (p = 0.648). Finally, the sex differences of the comparison between DM and non-DM for gastrointestinal cancer risk at different sites were variable after stratification for different effect estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggested female-to-male RRR of DM was increased for GC, while reduced for HCC and CC. However, there were no sex differences for the relation between DM and the risk of EC, CRC, PC, and RC.

Detection of anomalous cells such as cancer cells from normal blood cells has the potential to contribute greatly to cancer diagnosis and therapy. Conventional methods for the detection of cancer cells are usually tedious and cumbersome. Herein, we report on the use of a particle size analyzer for the convenient size-based differentiation of cancer cells from normal cells. Measurements made using a particle size analyzer revealed that size parameters for cancer cells are significantly greater (e.g., inner diameter and width) than the corresponding values for normal cells (white blood cells (WBC), lymphocytes and splenocytes), with no significant difference in shape parameters (e.g., circularity and convexity). The inner diameter of many cancer cell lines is greater than 10 microm, in contrast to normal cells. For the detection of WBC having similar size to that of cancer cells, we developed a PC software "Cancer Cell Finder" that differentiates them from cancer cells based on brightness stationary points on a cell surface. Furthermore, the aforementioned method was validated for cancer cell/clusters detection in spiked mouse blood samples (a B16 melanoma mouse xenograft model) and circulating tumor cell cluster-like particles in the cat and dog (diagnosed with cancer) blood samples. These results provide insights into the possible applicability of the use of a particle size analyzer in conjunction with PC software for the convenient detection of cancer cells in experimental and clinical samples for theranostics.

PURPOSE: This study aimed to report on cancer incidence and mortality for the year 2017 in Korea in order to estimate the nation's current cancer burden. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cancer incidence data from 1999 to 2014 were obtained from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database, and cancer mortality data from 1993 to 2015 were acquired from Statistics Korea. Cancer incidence and mortality were projected by fitting a linear regression model to observe age-specific cancer rates against observed years, and then multiplying the projected age-specific rates by the age-specific population. The Joinpoint regression model was used to determine at which year the linear trend changed significantly; we only used data of the latest trend. RESULTS: A total of 221,143 new cancer cases and 80,268 cancer deaths are expected to occur in Korea in 2017. The most common cancer sites are the colorectum, stomach, lung, thyroid, and breast. These five cancers represent half of the overall burden of cancer in Korea. For mortality, the most common sites are the lung, liver, colorectal, stomach, and pancreas. CONCLUSION: The incidence rate of all cancers in Korea appears to have decreased mainly because of a decrease in thyroid cancer. These up-to-date estimates of the cancer burden in Korea could be an important resource for planning and evaluation of cancer-control programs.

BACKGROUND: Little is known about how the individual decision styles and values of breast cancer patients at the time of treatment decision making are associated with the consideration of different treatment options and specifically with the consideration of contralateral prophylactic mastectomy (CPM). METHODS: Newly diagnosed patients with early-stage breast cancer who were treated in 2013-2014 were identified through the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries of Los Angeles and Georgia and were surveyed approximately 7 months after surgery (n = 2578; response rate, 71%). The primary outcome was the consideration of CPM (strong vs less strong). The association between patients' values and decision styles and strong consideration was assessed with multivariate logistic regression. RESULTS: Approximately one-quarter of women (25%) reported strong/very strong consideration of CPM, and another 29% considered it moderately/weakly. Decision styles, including a rational-intuitive approach to decision making, varied. The factors most valued by women at the time of treatment decision making were as follows: avoiding worry about recurrence (82%) and reducing the need for more surgery (73%). In a multivariate analysis, patients who preferred to make their own decisions, those who valued avoiding worry about recurrence, and those who valued avoiding radiation significantly more often strongly considered CPM (P < .05), whereas those who reported being more logical and those who valued keeping their breast did so less often. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients considered CPM, and the consideration was associated with both decision styles and values. The variability in decision styles and values observed in this study suggests that formally evaluating these characteristics at or before the initial treatment encounter could provide an opportunity for improving patient clinician discussions.

Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells. It is the second most common cause of death in the United States, and a significant proportion can be prevented. Underrepresented and underserved populations are less likely to receive routine medical procedures and experience a lower quality of health services. Despite the increase in cancer screening, there are disparities in the incidence and mortality of various cancers. These disparities are not fully explained by the correlations between minority race and lower socioeconomic status or minority race and insurance status. Considerations for global cancer control in low-resource settings are presented.

BACKGROUND: Cancer patients are 1.4 times more likely to be unemployed than healthy people. Therefore it is important to provide cancer patients with programmes to support the return-to-work (RTW) process. This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2011. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at enhancing RTW in cancer patients compared to alternative programmes including usual care or no intervention. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in the Cochrane Library Issue 3, 2014), MEDLINE (January 1966 to March 2014), EMBASE (January 1947 to March 2014), CINAHL (January 1983 to March, 2014), OSH-ROM and OSH Update (January 1960 to March, 2014), PsycINFO (January 1806 to 25 March 2014), DARE (January 1995 to March, 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov, Trialregister.nl and Controlled-trials.com up to 25 March 2014. We also examined the reference lists of included studies and selected reviews, and contacted authors of relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of the effectiveness of psycho-educational, vocational, physical, medical or multidisciplinary interventions enhancing RTW in cancer patients. The primary outcome was RTW measured as either RTW rate or sick leave duration measured at 12 months' follow-up. The secondary outcome was quality of life. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, assessed the risk of bias and extracted data. We pooled study results we judged to be clinically homogeneous in different comparisons reporting risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for each comparison using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: Fifteen RCTs including 1835 cancer patients met the inclusion criteria and because of multiple arms studies we included 19 evaluations. We judged six studies to have a high risk of bias and nine to have a low risk of bias. All included studies were conducted in high income countries and most studies were aimed at breast cancer patients (seven trials) or prostate cancer patients (two trials).Two studies involved psycho-educational interventions including patient education and teaching self-care behaviours. Results indicated low quality evidence of similar RTW rates for psycho-educational interventions compared to care as usual (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.35, n = 260 patients) and low quality evidence that there is no difference in the effect of psycho-educational interventions compared to care as usual on quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.05, 95% CI -0.2 to 0.3, n = 260 patients). We did not find any studies on vocational interventions. In one study breast cancer patients were offered a physical training programme. Low quality evidence suggested that physical training was not more effective than care as usual in improving RTW (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.32 to 4.54, n = 28 patients) or quality of life (SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.99 to 0.25, n = 41 patients).Seven RCTs assessed the effects of a medical intervention on RTW. In all studies a less radical or functioning conserving medical intervention was compared with a more radical treatment. We found low quality evidence that less radical, functioning conserving approaches had similar RTW rates as more radical treatments (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.09, n = 1097 patients) and moderate quality evidence of no differences in quality of life outcomes (SMD 0.10, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.23, n = 1028 patients).Five RCTs involved multidisciplinary interventions in which vocational counselling was combined with patient education, patient counselling, and biofeedback-assisted behavioral training or physical exercises. Moderate quality evidence showed that multidisciplinary interventions involving physical, psycho-educational and vocational components led to higher RTW rates than care as usual (RR 1.11, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.16, n = 450 patients). We found no differences in the effect of multidisciplinary interventions compared to care as usual on quality of life outcomes (SMD 0.03, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.25, n = 316 patients). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found moderate quality evidence that multidisciplinary interventions enhance the RTW of patients with cancer.

Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a well-established instigator of 'anti-cancer vaccination-effect (AVE)'. ICD has shown considerable preclinical promise, yet there remain subset of cancer patients that fail to respond to clinically-applied ICD inducers. Non-responsiveness to ICD inducers could be explained by the existence of cancer cell-autonomous, anti-AVE resistance mechanisms. However such resistance mechanisms remain poorly investigated. In this study, we have characterized for the first time, a naturally-occurring preclinical cancer model (AY27) that exhibits intrinsic anti-AVE resistance despite treatment with ICD inducers like mitoxantrone or hypericin-photodynamic therapy. Further mechanistic analysis revealed that this anti-AVE resistance was associated with a defect in exposing the important 'eat me' danger signal, surface-calreticulin (ecto-CRT/CALR). In an ICD setting, this defective ecto-CRT further correlated with severely reduced phagocytic clearance of AY27 cells as well as the failure of these cells to activate AVE. Defective ecto-CRT in response to ICD induction was a result of low endogenous CRT protein levels (i.e. CRTlow-phenotype) in AY27 cells. Exogenous reconstitution of ecto-rCRT (recombinant-CRT) improved the phagocytic removal of ICD inducer-treated AY27 cells, and importantly, significantly increased their AVE-activating ability. Moreover, we found that a subset of cancer patients of various cancer-types indeed possessed CALRlow or CRTlow-tumours. Remarkably, we found that tumoural CALRhigh-phenotype was predictive of positive clinical responses to therapy with ICD inducers (radiotherapy and paclitaxel) in lung and ovarian cancer patients, respectively. Furthermore, only in the ICD clinical setting, tumoural CALR levels positively correlated with the levels of various phagocytosis-associated genes relevant for phagosome maturation or processing. Thus, we reveal the existence of a cancer cell-autonomous, anti-AVE or anti-ICD resistance mechanism that has profound clinical implications for anticancer immunotherapy and cancer predictive biomarker analysis.

BACKGROUND: The validity of the Distress Thermometer (DT) as a screen for psychological distress in young adult cancer survivors was assessed by comparing it with the results of a psychiatric diagnostic interview, the Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) (SCID), to evaluate the accuracy of the DT and identify optimal cutoff scores for this population. METHODS: A total of 247 survivors aged 18 to 40 years completed the DT and SCID. Based on the SCID, participants were classified as having: 1) >/= 1 SCID diagnoses; 2) significant symptoms, but no SCID diagnosis; or 3) no significant SCID symptoms. Receiver operating characteristic analyses determined the sensitivity and specificity of all possible DT cutoff scores for detecting survivors with a SCID diagnosis, and subsequently for survivors with significant SCID symptoms or a SCID diagnosis. RESULTS: The recommended DT cutoff score of >/=5 failed to identify 31.81% of survivors with a SCID diagnosis (sensitivity of 68.18% and specificity of 78.33%), and 32.81% of survivors with either significant SCID symptoms or a SCID diagnosis. No alternative DT cutoff score met the criteria for acceptable sensitivity (>/=85%) and specificity (>/=75%). CONCLUSIONS: The DT does not reliably identify young adult cancer survivors with psychiatric problems identified by a "gold standard" structured psychiatric interview. Therefore, the DT should not be used as a stand-alone psychological screen in this population. Cancer 2016;122:296-303. (c) 2015 American Cancer Society.

Since the beginning of 2017, Chinese Journal of Cancer has published a series of important questions in cancer research and clinical oncology, which sparkle diverse thoughts, interesting communications, and potential collaborations among researchers all over the world. In this article, 10 more questions are presented as followed. Question 57. What are the major stresses that drive the formation, progression, and metastasis of a cancer? Question 58. What is the mechanism responsible for altering an acidic intracellular pH and a basic extracellular pH in normal tissue cells to a basic intracellular pH and an acidic extracellular pH in cancer cells, a fundamental and yet largely ignored phenomenon? Question 59. Where are the tumor-associated plasma microRNAs from in cancer patients? Question 60. Can we identify mechanisms employed by tumor subpopulations to evade standard therapies and seed relapse/metastatic tumors before treatment? Question 61. Why are mutation rates in epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (ERBB2) higher in lung cancer from never smokers than that from smokers? Question 62. Does tumor vasculogenic mimicry contribute to the resistance against antiangiogenic therapy in renal cancer? Question 63. What molecular targeted drugs would be effective for non-clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), especially metastatic papillary RCC and chromophobe RCC? Question 64. Can it be more effective by targeting both the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and MET signaling pathways in sporadic metastatic papillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC)? Question 65. What are the predictive biomarkers that may be used to identify the renal cell carcinoma (RCC) patients who can benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment? Question 66. How do we identify predictive molecular biomarkers to stratify clear cell renal cell carcinoma patients for targeted therapies?

BACKGROUND: Cancer patients experience pain that has physiological, sensory, affective, cognitive, behavioral, and sociocultural dimensions. Opioids are used in treatment of pain in patients with various types of cancer. We previously showed that the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) genotype is related to the plasma level of morphine and the required dose of morphine in an exploratory prospective study. The findings showed that a group of patients with a GG single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs4680 in COMT required a significantly higher dose of morphine than a non-GG group. A biomarker for selection of opioids for cancer pain relief would be particularly useful clinically, and therefore we have planned a randomized comparative study of morphine and oxycodone, using the COMT rs4680 SNP as a biomarker. This study is aimed at verifying the assumption that patients in the GG group require an increased morphine dose for pain relief. METHODS: The RELIEF study is a randomized, multi-institutional, open-label trial with a primary endpoint of the proportion of subjects requiring high-dose opioids, as calculated from the dose of a rescue preparation administered on day 0. Secondary endpoints include the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Short form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C15-PAL, Pain Catastrophizing Scale, and adverse events, Eligibility criteria are patients with advanced carcinoma with non-daily use of opioids in initial screening for registration; and cancer pain targeted for daily opioid treatment, NSAIDs or acetaminophen, NRS >/=3(average over 24 h), opioid-treatment naive within 30 h, no chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or bisphosphonate administration newly started within 2 weeks, and written informed consent at the time of second registration. Between November 2014 and June 2017, an estimated 110 patients from two sites in Japan were randomized (1:1) to morphine or oxycodone in GG and non-GG groups. DISCUSSION: A method for selection of appropriate opioids in cancer patients is a high unmet medical need. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of different opioids in patients with cancer based on gene polymorphism, as the first potential multi-institutional registration trial to be conducted in cancer patients with pain. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN000015579 Date of registration: 4 November 2014. It is updated once every six months, the latest update is 30 June 2017. Trial status. The enrollment started in November 2014. At the time of manuscript submission (July 2017), Three-quarters of patients have participated. We thus expect to complete the recruitment by March 2018.

BACKGROUND: Transdermal fentanyl (TDF) is 1 of the most common opioids prescribed to patients with cancer. However, the accurate opioid rotation ratio (ORR) from other opioids to TDF is unknown, and various currently used methods result in wide variation of the ORR. The objective of this study was to determine the ORR of the oral morphine equivalent daily dose (MEDD) to the TDF dose when correcting for the MEDD of breakthrough opioids (the net MEDD) in cancer outpatients. METHODS: The records of 6790 consecutive patients were reviewed at the authors' supportive care center from 2010 to 2013 to identify those who underwent rotation from other opioids to TDF. Data regarding Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale scores and MEDDs were collected for patients who returned for a follow-up visit within 5 weeks. Linear regression analysis was used to estimate the ORR between the TDF dose and the net MEDD (the MEDD before opioid rotation [OR] minus the MEDD of the breakthrough opioid used along with TDF after OR). RESULTS: In total, 129 patients underwent OR from other opioids to TDF. The mean patient age was 56 years, 59% were men, and 88% had advanced cancer. Uncontrolled pain (80%) was the most frequent reason for OR. In 101 patients who underwent OR and had no worsening of pain at follow-up, the median ORR from net MEDD to TDF (in mg per day) was 0.01 (range, -0.02 to 0.04), and the correlation coefficient of the TDF dose to the net MEDD was 0.77 (P < .0001). The ORR was not significantly impacted by body mass index or serum albumin. The ORR of 0.01 suggests that an MEDD of 100 mg is equivalent to 1 mg TDF daily or approximately 40 micrograms per hour of TDF (1000 micrograms/24 hours). CONCLUSIONS: The median ORR from MEDD to TDF in mg per day was 0.01. These results warrant further studies.

Persons with a family history (FH) of colorectal cancer (CRC) or adenomas that are not due to known hereditary syndromes have an increased risk for CRC. An understanding of these risks, screening recommendations, and screening behaviors can inform strategies for reducing the CRC burden in these families. A comprehensive review of the literature published within the past 10 years has been performed to assess what is known about cancer risk, screening guidelines, adherence and barriers to screening, and effective interventions in persons with an FH of CRC and to identify FH tools used to identify these individuals and inform care. Existing data show that having 1 affected first-degree relative (FDR) increases the CRC risk 2-fold, and the risk increases with multiple affected FDRs and a younger age at diagnosis. There is variability in screening recommendations across consensus guidelines. Screening adherence is <50% and is lower in persons under the age of 50 years. A provider's recommendation, multiple affected relatives, and family encouragement facilitate screening; insufficient collection of FH, low knowledge of guidelines, and poor family communication are important barriers. Effective interventions incorporate strategies for overcoming barriers, but these have not been broadly tested in clinical settings. Four strategies for reducing CRC in persons with familial risk are suggested: 1) improving the collection and utilization of the FH of cancer, 2) establishing a consensus for screening guidelines by FH, 3) enhancing provider-patient knowledge of guidelines and communication about CRC risk, and 4) encouraging survivors to promote screening within their families and partnering with existing screening programs to expand their reach to high-risk groups.

BACKGROUND: The authors sought to determine the effect of chemotherapy on the development of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in premenopausal and postmenopausal women undergoing (neo)adjuvant therapy for early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: A total of 86 women with early-stage (AJCC stage I-III) breast cancer who were free from clinically diagnosed MetS (defined as 3 of 5 components of MetS) were prospectively tested for the presence of the 5 components of MetS within 1 week before initiating and after completing (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy. The 5 components of MetS measured were waist circumference; blood pressure; and fasting levels of blood glucose, triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Anthropometrics (body weight, percentage body fat, fat mass), lipid profile (total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), glucose metabolism (insulin, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, glycated hemoglobin), and inflammation (C-reactive protein) also were examined before initiating and after completing treatment. RESULTS: The current study included 46 premenopausal and 40 postmenopausal women. All individual MetS components and the overall MetS score were found to be statistically significantly increased (P<.01) after chemotherapy. Body weight, percentage body fat, fat mass, lipids, glucose metabolism, and inflammation also were found to be statistically significantly increased (P<.01). CONCLUSIONS: A 12-week to 18-week course of chemotherapy appears to statistically significantly increase MetS and related anthropometrics, biomarkers of glucose metabolism, and inflammation in patients with early-stage breast cancer with no preexisting MetS. Lifestyle interventions such as diet and exercise may be preventive approaches for use during chemotherapy to reduce the onset of MetS in patients with breast cancer. Cancer 2016.

BACKGROUND: Survivors of childhood cancer are at considerable risk of experiencing treatment-related adverse health outcomes. To provide survivors with specialized care focused on these risks during adulthood, the government of Ontario funded a provincial network of specialized survivor clinics in 1999. The aim of this study was to determine whether prior attendance at survivor clinics by adult survivors of childhood cancer was associated with rates of emergency department (ED) visits. METHODS: This was a population-based, retrospective cohort study using multiple linked administrative health databases. The cohort consisted of all adult survivors of childhood cancer diagnosed between January 1, 1986 and December 31, 2005 in Ontario, Canada. A recurrent event regression model was used to evaluate the association between prior attendance at survivor clinics and the rate of ED visits; adjustments were made for individual, demographic, treatment, and provider characteristics. RESULTS: The study consisted of 3912 adult survivors of childhood cancer. Individuals who had at least 1 prior visit to a survivor clinic had a 19% decreased rate of ED visits in comparison with individuals who had not visited a survivor clinic (adjusted relative rate, 0.81; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-0.85). Each additional prior visit to a survivor clinic was associated with a 5% decrease in the rate of ED visits (adjusted relative rate, 0.95; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-0.96). These results were independent of whether or not survivors received care from a primary care physician. CONCLUSIONS: Attendance at a specialized survivor clinic was significantly associated with decreased ED visits among adult survivors of childhood cancer.

BACKGROUND: Currently, there are between 300,000 and 500,000 childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) in Europe. A significant proportion is at high risk, and at least 60% of them develop adverse health-related outcomes that can appear several years after treatment completion. Many survivors are unaware of their personal risk, and there seems to be a general lack of information among healthcare providers about pathophysiology and natural history of treatment-related complications. This can generate incorrect or delayed diagnosis and treatments. METHOD: The Survivorship Passport (SurPass) consists of electronic documents, which summarise the clinical history of the childhood or adolescent cancer survivor. It was developed by paediatric oncologists of the PanCare and SIOPE networks and IT experts of Cineca, together with parents, patients, and survivors' organisations within the European Union-funded European Network for Cancer research in Children and Adolescents. It consists of a template of a web-based, simply written document, translatable in all European languages, to be given to each CCS. The SurPass provides a summary of each survivor's clinical history, with detailed information about the original cancer and of treatments received, together with personalised follow-up and screening recommendations based on guidelines published by the International Guidelines Harmonization Group and PanCareSurFup. RESULTS: The SurPass data schema contains a maximum of 168 variables and uses internationally approved nomenclature, except for radiotherapy fields, where a new classification was defined by radiotherapy experts. The survivor-specific screening recommendations are mainly based on treatment received and are automatically suggested, thanks to built-in algorithms. These may be adapted and further individualised by the treating physician in case of special disease and survivor circumstances. The SurPass was tested at the Istituto Giannina Gaslini, Italy, and received positive feedback. It is now being integrated at the institutional, regional and national level. CONCLUSIONS: The SurPass is potentially an essential tool for improved and more harmonised follow-up of CCS. It also has the potential to be a useful tool for empowering CCSs to be responsible for their own well-being and preventing adverse events whenever possible. With sufficient commitment on the European level, this solution should increase the capacity to respond more effectively to the needs of European CCS.

BACKGROUND: African American (AA) women are known to have poorer breast cancer survival than whites, and the differences may be related to underlying disparities in their clinical presentation or access to care. This study evaluated the relationship between demographic, treatment, and socioeconomic factors and breast cancer survival among women in southeast Michigan. METHODS: The population included 2387 women (34% AA) with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to III breast cancer who were treated at the Henry Ford Health System (HFHS) from 1996 through 2005. Linked data sets from the HFHS, the Metropolitan Detroit Cancer Surveillance System, and the US Census Bureau were used to obtain demographic and clinical information. Comorbidities were classified with the modified Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). Economic deprivation was categorized with a census tract-based deprivation index (DI), which was stratified into 5 quintiles of increasing socioeconomic disadvantage. RESULTS: Compared with whites, AA women were significantly more likely to have larger, hormone receptor-negative tumors and more comorbidities and to reside in an economically deprived area. In an unadjusted analysis, AAs had a significantly higher risk of death (hazard ratio [HR], 1.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.59); however, after adjustments for clinical (age, stage, hormone receptor, and CCI) and societal factors (DI), the effect of race was not significant (HR, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.96-1.34] , and HR, 0.97 [0.80-1.19] respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Racial differences in breast cancer survival can be explained by clinical and socioeconomic factors. Nonetheless, AA women with breast cancer remain disproportionately affected by unfavorable tumor characteristics and economic deprivation, which likely contribute to their increased overall mortality.

Cancer cells employ both conventional oxidative metabolism and glycolytic anaerobic metabolism. However, their proliferation is marked by a shift towards increasing glycolytic metabolism even in the presence of O2 (Warburg effect). HIF1, a major hypoxia induced transcription factor, promotes a dissociation between glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle, a process limiting the efficient production of ATP and citrate which otherwise would arrest glycolysis. The Warburg effect also favors an intracellular alkaline pH which is a driving force in many aspects of cancer cell proliferation (enhancement of glycolysis and cell cycle progression) and of cancer aggressiveness (resistance to various processes including hypoxia, apoptosis, cytotoxic drugs and immune response). This metabolism leads to epigenetic and genetic alterations with the occurrence of multiple new cell phenotypes which enhance cancer cell growth and aggressiveness. In depth understanding of these metabolic changes in cancer cells may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies, which when combined with existing cancer treatments, might improve their effectiveness and/or overcome chemoresistance.

BACKGROUND: There are inconsistent and limited data regarding the risk of myeloid neoplasms (MN) among breast cancer survivors who received radiotherapy (RT) in the absence of chemotherapy. Concern about subsequent MN might influence the decision to use adjuvant RT for women with localized disease. As patients with therapy-related MN have generally poor outcomes, the presumption of subsequent MN being therapy-related could affect treatment recommendations. METHODS: We used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database to study older women with in-situ or stage 1-3 breast cancer diagnosed 2001-2009 who received surgery. Chemotherapy and RT were ascertained using Medicare claims, and new MN diagnoses were captured using both SEER registry and Medicare claims. We excluded women who received chemotherapy for initial treatment, and censored at receipt of subsequent chemotherapy. Competing-risk survival analysis was used to assess the association between RT and risk of subsequent MN adjusting for relevant characteristics. RESULTS: Median follow-up for 60,426 eligible patients was 68 months (interquartile range, 46 to 92 months), with 47.6% receiving RT. In total, 316 patients (0.52%) were diagnosed with MN; the cumulative incidence per 10,000 person-years was 10.6 vs 9.0 among RT-treated vs non-RT-treated women, respectively (p = .004); the increased risk of subsequent MN persisted in the adjusted analysis (hazard ratio = 1.36, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-1.80). The results were consistent in multiple sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that RT is associated with a significant risk of subsequent MN among older breast cancer survivors, though the absolute risk increase is very small. These findings suggest the benefits of RT outweigh the risks of development of subsequent MN.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a severe clinical process and has a high rate of fatality. Cancer patients have a high incidence rate of venous thrombosis complication and increase the mortality of cancer patients for 2-8 times. The mechanisms involved in human cancers and venous thrombosis remains unclear. In this study, we determined miR-21 expressed higher in human breast cancer, colon cancer and hepatocellular cancer tissues compared with normal tissues and expressed higher in exosomes of breast cancer and hepatocellular cancer cell lines compared with normal cells. MiR-21 dramatically suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), which performed promoting role in thrombus repairment and resolution. High levels of miR-21 in exosomes of human cancers dramatically inhibited behaviors of EPCs, and depletion of miR-21 abrogated the decreased proliferation, migration and invasion of EPCs induced by human cancer cells. Moreover, IL6R (interleukin 6 receptor) was identified to be a direct target of miR-21 and promoted cell proliferation, migration and invasion of EPCs. Therefore, the miR-21-IL6R pathway contributed to behaviors of EPCs and consequently mediated the vein thrombosis in patients with cancer. MiR-21-IL6R pathway based therapeutic methods would be beneficial to decrease the complicated venous thrombosis in cancer patients and promote thrombus resolution.

INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to assess the influence of metformin on the prevalence of cancer and risk factors for the development of cancer, in patients with type 2 diabetes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 1063 patients, treated between October 2012 and March 2013 in the Diabetes and Endocrinology Centre in Bydgoszcz, were enrolled in the study. Only patients who were first diagnosed with diabetes and consecutively with cancer were included in the analysis. The final dataset compromised data from 1028 patients with type 2 diabetes, in whom retrospective analysis of the association between the occurrence of cancer and treatment with or without metformin was performed. Demographic data, medical history, physical assessment, diabetes history, diabetes complications, concomitant medication, and additional examination results were compared between two groups: those with cancer and those without cancer. Data were analysed using Student's t-test, Chi-square test with Yates' continuity correction, and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: The most commonly observed cancer was breast cancer (24 patients; 22.5%), followed by uterine cancer (15 patients; 13.6%). Of the 75 diabetic patients with a cancer diagnosis, 18.7% were treated with metformin; of the 953 patients without cancer, 38% received metformin. Analysis of probability of cancer occurrence using Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the probability of cancer development was higher in groups of patients who were not treated with metformin (p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Metformin treatment reduces the risk of cancer in type 2 diabetes patients.

Recently, there have been considerable advancements in cancer therapies thereby prolonging the life of cancer survivors. However, these recent advancements present new challenges in the management of bone disease in cancer survivors. Bone acts as a fertile soil for cancer seeding and bone health is often compromised because of increased inflammatory cytokines in cancer, direct cancer metastasis and toxic effects of anti-cancer therapies. This effect is more pronounced in elderly population who already have compromised bone mineral density leading to increased skeletal related events and bone pain. Timely diagnosis and effective interventions are essential for reducing bone-related morbidity in cancer survivors. Also, a complex interdependence exists between cancer related bone disease and tumor growth, creating a vicious circle of extensive bone destruction and cancer progression. Hence, maintenance of bone health and integrity plays a pivotal role in comprehensive cancer care. The bone-targeted treatments have been shown to preserve bone health, and modify the course of the underlying cancer. Management of long-term bone health requires a broad knowledge base that endocrinologists, oncologists and other care team members should be aware of. The manuscript highlights the skeletal effects of cancer, adjuvant therapies used for hormone-responsive cancers, chemotherapy induced bone loss and steps for accurate diagnosis and management of bone disease in cancer survivors by bridging the gaps in the comprehensive cancer care.

BACKGROUND: Several studies have suggested that global DNA methylation in circulating white blood cells (WBC) is associated with breast cancer risk. METHODS: To address conflicting results and concerns that the findings for WBC DNA methylation in some prior studies may reflect disease effects, we evaluated the relationship between global levels of WBC DNA methylation in white blood cells and breast cancer risk in a case-control study nested within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) cohort. A total of 428 invasive breast cancer cases and 419 controls, frequency matched on age at entry (55-59, 60-64, 65-69, >/=70 years), year of entry (on/before September 30, 1997, on/after October 1, 1997) and period of DNA extraction (previously extracted, newly extracted) were included. The ratio of 5-methyl-2' deoxycytidine [5-mdC] to 2'-deoxyguanine [dG], assuming [dG] = [5-mdC] + [2'-deoxycytidine [dC]] (%5-mdC), was determined by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, an especially accurate method for assessing total genomic DNA methylation. RESULTS: Odds ratio (OR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for breast cancer risk adjusted for age at entry, year of entry, and period of DNA extraction, were 1.0 (referent), 0.89 (95% CI, 0.6-1.3), 0.88 (95% CI, 0.6-1.3), and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.6-1.2) for women in the highest compared to lowest quartile levels of %5md-C (p for trend = .39). Effects did not meaningfully vary by time elapsed from WBC collection to diagnosis. DISCUSSION: These results do not support the hypothesis that global DNA hypomethylation in WBC DNA is associated with increased breast cancer risk prior to the appearance of clinical disease.

BACKGROUND: The ICON6 trial showed that cediranib, an oral inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors 1, 2, and 3, improved clinical outcomes for patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer when it was used with chemotherapy and was continued as maintenance therapy. This study describes health-related quality of life (QOL) during the first year of treatment. METHODS: Four hundred fifty-six women were randomly allocated to receive standard chemotherapy only, chemotherapy with concurrent cediranib, or chemotherapy with cediranib administered concurrently and continued as maintenance. Patients completed QOL questionnaires until disease progression every 3 weeks during chemotherapy and then every 6 weeks to 1 year. Patients alive with disease progression completed a QOL form 1 year after randomization. The primary QOL endpoint was the global score from the Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer) at 1 year, with the standard chemotherapy group compared with the concurrent-maintenance cediranib group. RESULTS: The rate of questionnaire compliance was 90% at the baseline and 76% at 1 year and was similar across the 3 groups. The mean global QOL score at 1 year was 62.6 points for the standard chemotherapy group and 68.7 points for the concurrent-maintenance group (+4.5; 95% confidence interval, -2.0 to 11.0; P = .18). Sensitivity analyses suggested that this finding was robust to the effect of missing data, and the improvement became statistically significant after adjustments for self-reported diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: The 6th study by the International Collaboration in Ovarian Neoplasm (ICON6) showed a significant improvement in progression-free survival with cediranib as concurrent and maintenance therapy. No QOL detriment with cediranib was found 1 year after treatment was commenced. The maintenance of QOL along with prolonged cancer control suggests that cediranib has a valuable role in the treatment of relapsed ovarian cancer. Cancer 2017;123:2752-61. (c) 2017 The Authors.

Objective: To understand the acceptance and personal demand for cancer screening service among the urban residents who had never been involved in any national level cancer screening programs in China and identify the key factors influencing the sustainability of cancer screening. Methods: A questionnaire survey was conducted among the local people aged 40-69 years selected through convenience sampling in 16 provinces of China to collect the general information about their demands for the screening service and others. Results: A total of 16 394 qualified questionnaires were completed. The average age of the people surveyed was (53.8+/-8.0) years, and men accounted for 44.6%. Without concerning the cost, 4 831 people (29.5%) had no demands for cancer screening services, the reasons are as follow: they would like to go to see doctors only when they were ill (61.8%); they had already received similar medical examinations (36.8%) and they would like to receive cancer screening directly without pre-health risk assessment (33.0%). Among the people surveyed, 10 795 (65.8%) had demands for cancer screening services, but they had choice on the screening settings, 43.7% wanted to receive the service in a general hospitals, while 36.5% would like to go to cancer-specialized hospitals. As for the level of medical institutes providing cancer screening service, 61.4% of the people surveyed would choose a higher level one, while 36.4% would choose an ordinary one. On screening procedures, 61.5% of the people surveyed would accept the mode of "clinical examination after questionnaire-assessment" . Conclusion: Most people surveyed had demands for cancer screening services and they would like to receive the screening services in higher level medical institutes. It is suggested to spread cancer screening know ledge, and strengthen the capability building of screening in grass root medical institutes to attract more people to receive cancer screening.

BACKGROUND: Immunoglobulin E (IgE) is produced by plasma cells, often as part of an allergic immune response. It is currently unknown whether plasma IgE levels are associated with risk of cancer in individuals from the general population. We tested the hypothesis that high levels of plasma total IgE are associated with overall risk of cancer and with risk of specific cancers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma total IgE was measured in 37 747 individuals from the general population, and the participants were followed prospectively for up to 30 years. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 7 years, a first cancer was diagnosed in 3454 participants. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio for a 10-fold higher level of IgE was 1.05 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.11; P = 0.04] for any cancer, 0.44 (0.30-0.64; P = 0.00002) for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), 0.53 (0.33-0.84; P = 0.007) for multiple myeloma, 1.54 (1.04-2.29; P = 0.03) for other non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 1.38 (1.04-1.84; P = 0.03) for cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, and 1.12 (1.00-1.25; P = 0.05) for lung cancer. The findings for CLL and multiple myeloma were generally robust; however, after correcting for 27 multiple comparisons only the finding for CLL remained significant. CONCLUSION: High levels of plasma total IgE were associated with low risk of CLL and possibly of multiple myeloma, without convincing evidence for high risk of any cancer type.

BACKGROUND: Practically all data on familial risk in ovarian and other cancers are based on incident cancer, whereas familiality in cancer mortality is largely unknown. If fatal forms of cancer are a highly familial subtype, then familial risk for mortality may exceed that of incidence, which is relevant for clinical decision making and counseling. METHODS: Ovarian cancer patients in the nationwide Swedish Family Cancer Database were classified according to fatal and nonfatal (incident) family history. Familial risks for incident and fatal ovarian cancer were calculated for offspring based on their parental or sibling family history of any cancer using standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for incidence and standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) for mortality. Offspring without family history were referents. RESULTS: The database included 24,757 mothers and 8138 daughters with ovarian cancer. When a mother had ovarian cancer, the SIR for incident ovarian cancer in daughters was 2.69, and when a sister had ovarian cancer it was 3.49. The SMRs for fatal cancer by fatal cancer in probands were 3.39 and 5.80, respectively. For fatal serous cancers among siblings, the SMR was 6.16, compared with 10.01 for the endometrioid type. Ovarian cancer was associated with maternal (SIR, 1.22; SMR, 1.56) and sororal breast cancer (SIR, 1.27). Another discordant association was between ovarian and paternal prostate cancer (SIR, 1.12; SMR, 1.66). CONCLUSIONS: Fatal familial risks were higher for concordant ovarian, ovarian-breast, and ovarian-prostate cancers than the corresponding incident risks. This may suggest that highly fatal subtypes exist for these cancers, calling for genetic dissection.

Objective: To understand the constituent and workload of service providers engaged in cancer screening in China and provide evidence for the assessment of the sustainability of national cancer screening project. Methods: Using either questionnaire or online approach, the survey was conducted in 16 provinces, where Cancer Screening Program in Urban China (CanSPUC) was conducted, from 2014 to 2015. The medical institutes surveyed included hospitals [71.1% were class (A) hospitals], centers for disease control and prevention (CDCs) and community centers where cancer screening was undertaken during 2013-2015. The questionnaire survey was conducted among the staffs responsible for the overall coordination, management and implementation of the screening project to collect the information about the allocation, workload and compensation of the service providers from different specialties. Results: A total of 4 626 staffs were surveyed in this study, their average age was (37.7+/-9.5) years, and males accounted for 31.0%. Human resources allocated differed with province. The number of senior staff ranged from 6 (Chongqing) to 43 (Beijing) among the 8 comparable provinces. Among the staffs surveyed, 2 192 were from hospitals, 431 were from CDCs and 1 990 were from community centers, and the staffs who complained heavy workload accounted for 19.9%, 24.6% and 34.1% respectively (P<0.001). Among 227 staffs for overall coordination, 376 management staffs and 3 908 staffs for implementation, those who complained heavy workload accounted for 23.6%, 22.3% and 28.2% respectively (P<0.001). A total of 3 244 staffs (73.8%) got compensations for heavy workload. The compensation types were manly labor fee linked with workload (67.5%) and labor fee regardless workload (26.6%). Conclusion: The province specific differences in human resources allocation indicated the differences in screening project's organizing pattern and capability. It is suggested to conduct routine cancer screening (using specialized staffs), reduce the workload of the first line and community staffs and increase the compensation for the service providers for the sustainability of cancer screening project in China.

BACKGROUND: Few studies have prospectively examined the relationship between vitamin D status and prostate cancer risk in black men, a group at high risk for both low vitamin D status and prostate cancer. METHODS: Among black men in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, we identified 226 prostate cancer cases and 452 controls matched on age at randomization (+/-5 years), date of blood draw (+/-30 days), calendar year of cohort entry, and time since baseline prostate cancer screening (+/-1 year). Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the associations between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], vitamin D binding protein (DBP), the 25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio, and prostate cancer risk. RESULTS: Serum 25(OH)D was not associated with overall prostate cancer (Q4 vs Q1: OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.40-1.33; P for trend = .25), although there were apparent inverse associations for nonaggressive disease (global P = .03, clinical stage I/II, and Gleason score <7) and among men >/=62 years old (P for interaction = .04) that were restricted to Q3. Interestingly, serum DBP was significantly inversely associated with prostate cancer risk (Q4 vs Q1: OR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.20-1.00; P for trend = .03), whereas the 25(OH)D:DBP molar ratio was not. Results were similar when we mutually adjusted for 25(OH)D and DBP, and we found no evidence of interaction between the two. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests higher (versus lower) circulating DBP may be independently associated with a decreased prostate cancer risk in black men independent of 25(OH)D status.

BACKGROUND: Postdiagnosis weight gain in patients with breast cancer has been associated with increased cancer recurrence and mortality. This study was designed to identify risk factors for weight gain and create a predictive model to identify a high-risk population for targeted interventions. METHODS: The weight of 393 patients with breast cancer from the Northwestern Robert H. Lurie Cancer Center was measured over a 2-year period from diagnosis, with body mass index (BMI) change over 18 months as the primary endpoint. Demographics, clinical factors, treatment methods, as well as tumor characteristics were also recorded; and a lifestyle questionnaire was conducted. Blood samples were genotyped for 16 single nucleotide polymorphisms in FTO, adiponectin pathway genes (ADIPOQ, ADIPOR1), and FNDC5. Serum leptin, adiponectin, and irisin levels also were measured. RESULTS: Mean +/- standard deviation 18-month BMI changes were 0.68 +/- 1.42, 0.98 +/- 1.62, 0.79 +/- 1.74, and -0.44 +/- 1.58 kg/m(2) for patients ages <40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, and >/=60 years, respectively. The optimal multivariable model for 18-month BMI change contained the predictors age, height, and endocrine therapy, but only age was statistically significant, with a 0.04 kg/m(2) increase in 18-month BMI change per younger year of age. Single nucleotide polymorphisms in ADIPOR1, FTO, and FNDC5 were associated with 18-month BMI change, and the first 2 remained significant after adjusting for the optimal clinical model (all P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Women age 60 years and younger at the time of breast cancer diagnosis who have an obesity genetic risk model are at increased risk for weight gain after treatment and should be targeted for weight-maintenance interventions.

BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence has increased among young adults (YAs) and survival rates have not improved compared with other age groups. Patient-reported outcomes may enhance our understanding of this vulnerable population. METHODS: In a multisite prospective study, patients completed a cancer symptom inventory at the time of enrollment (T1) and 4 weeks to 5 weeks later (T2). YAs (those aged </= 39 years) with breast or colorectal cancer were compared with older adults (those aged >/= 40 years) with breast or colorectal cancer with regard to symptom severity, symptom interference, changes over time, and medical care. RESULTS: Participants included 1544 patients with breast cancer (96 of whom were YAs) and 718 patients with colorectal cancer (37 of whom were YAs). Compared with older adults, YAs with breast cancer were more likely to report moderate/severe drowsiness, hair loss, and symptom interference with relationships at T1. YAs with colorectal cancer were more likely to report moderate/severe pain, fatigue, nausea, distress, drowsiness, shortness of breath, and rash plus interference in general activity, mood, work, relationships, and life enjoyment compared with older adults. Compared with older adults, shortness of breath, appetite, and sore mouth were more likely to improve in YAs with breast cancer; vomiting was less likely to improve in YAs with colorectal cancer. Referrals for supportive care were few, especially among patients with colorectal cancer. YAs with breast cancer were somewhat more likely to be referred to nutrition and psychiatry services than older patients. CONCLUSIONS: YAs reported symptom severity, symptom interference, and variations over time that were distinct from older patients. Distinctions were found to differ by diagnostic group. These findings enhance the understanding of symptom burden in YAs and inform the development of targeted interventions and future research.

Hysterectomy on benign indications is associated with an increased risk for adverse health effects. However, little is known about the association between hysterectomy and subsequent cancer occurrence later in life. The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of hysterectomy on the incidence of cancer. In this population-based cohort study, we used data on 111,595 hysterectomized and 537,9843 nonhysterectomized women from nationwide Swedish Health Care registers including the Inpatient Register, the Cancer Register and the Cause of Death Register between 1973 and 2009. Hysterectomy with or without concomitant bilateral salpingo-ophorectomy (BSO) performed on benign indications was considered as exposure and incidence of primary cancers was used as outcome measure. Rare primary cancers (<100 cases for the two groups combined) were excluded from analysis. A marginal risk reduction for any cancer was observed for women with previous hysterectomy and for those with hysterectomy and concurrent BSO (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.91-0.95 and HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.87-0.96, respectively). Compared to nonhysterectomized women, significant risks were observed for thyroid cancer (HR 1.76, 95% CI 1.45-2.14). For both hysterectomy and hysterectomy with BSO, an association with brain cancer was observed (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.32-1.65 and HR 1.45, 95% CI 1.15-1.83, respectively). Hysterectomy, with or without BSO, was not associated with breast, lung or gastrointestinal cancer. We conclude that hysterectomy on benign indications is associated with an increased risk for thyroid and brain cancer later in life. Further research efforts are needed to identify patient groups at risk of malignancy following hysterectomy.

BACKGROUND: The prognostic value of the systemic inflammatory response in cancer has been well established in observational studies. This review aims to examine and rationalise the evidence for the role of systemic inflammation based prognostic scores in randomised clinical trials. METHOD: An extensive literature review using targeted medical subject headings was carried out in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CDSR databases until January 2018. Titles were examined for relevance and after exclusions bibliographies were hand searched to identify additional trials. RESULTS: There were 29 trials containing data on 37,020 patients presented in full paper form and 8 trials containing data on 3805 patients presented in abstract form. Most trials were published within the last three years. Seven trials containing data on 6044 patients were published in 2015. Eight trials containing data on 4384 patients were published in 2016. Twelve trials containing data on 27,228 patients were published in 2017. The majority of trials were in advanced inoperable cancer and colorectal cancer was the most common cancer type with 11 articles containing data on 27,909 patients. The GPS/mGPS was shown to have prognostic value in randomised clinical trials in NSCLC, oesophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer. The NLR/dNLR was shown to have prognostic value in randomised clinical trials in nasopharyngeal cancer, oesophageal cancer, pancreatic cancer, biliary cancer, prostate cancer and multiple cancer types. CONCLUSION: The prognostic value of systemic inflammation based prognostic scores has been confirmed in multiple trials and should be incorporated into future prospective randomised clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Patients with recurrent and/or metastatic, radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma have limited treatment options. Sorafenib, an oral kinase inhibitor, is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma, although it demonstrated low response rates (12.2%) as a single agent in the first-line setting. The objective of the current study was to determine whether adding the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor temsirolimus to sorafenib could improve on these results. METHODS: In this single-institution, phase 2 study, 36 patients with metastatic, radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma of follicular origin received treatment with the combination of oral sorafenib (200 mg twice daily) and intravenous temsirolimus (25 mg weekly). The receipt of prior systemic treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and targeted therapy, including sorafenib, was permitted. The primary endpoint was the radiographic response rate. RESULTS: The best response was a partial response in 8 patients (22%), stable disease in 21 (58%), and progressive disease in 1 (3%). Six patients were not evaluable for a response. Patients who had received any prior systemic treatment had a response rate of 10% compared with 38% of those who had not received prior systemic treatment. One of 2 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer had an objective response. The progression-free survival rate at 1 year was 30.5%. The most common grade 3 and 4 toxicities associated with sorafenib and temsirolimus included hyperglycemia, fatigue, anemia, and oral mucositis. CONCLUSIONS: Sorafenib and temsirolimus appear to be an active combination in patients with radioactive iodine-refractory thyroid carcinoma, especially in patients who received no prior treatment compared with historic data from single-agent sorafenib. Activity is also observed in patients who previously received sorafenib. This regimen warrants further investigation. Cancer 2017;123:4114-4121. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: A recent study estimates that 277,000 colorectal cancer (CRC) cases and 203,000 CRC deaths will be averted between 2013 and 2030 if the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable goal of increasing CRC screening prevalence to 80% by 2018 is reached. However, the number of individuals who need to be screened (NNS) to achieve this goal is unknown. In this communication, the authors estimate the NNS to achieve 80% by 2018 nationwide and by state. METHODS: The authors estimated the NNS by subtracting adults aged 50 to 75 years who would need to be screened to achieve an 80% CRC screening prevalence from the number who are currently guideline-compliant from population estimates for this age group. The 2013 National Health Interview Survey and the 2012 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System were used to estimate CRC screening prevalence and data from the US Census Bureau were used to estimate population projections. The NNS were age-standardized and sex-standardized. RESULTS: Nationwide, 24.39 million individuals (95% confidence interval, 24.37-24.41 million) aged 50 to 75 years will need to be screened to achieve 80% by 2018. By state, the NNS ranged from 45,400 in Vermont to 2.72 million in California. The majority of individuals who need to be screened are aged 50 to 64 years and the largest subgroup is privately insured. CONCLUSIONS: The authors estimated that at least 24.4 million additional individuals in the United States will need to be screened to achieve the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable goal of increasing CRC screening prevalence to 80% by 2018. To reach this goal, improving facilitators of CRC screening, including physician recommendation and patient awareness, is needed.

BACKGROUND: The 5-year relative survival for prostate cancers diagnosed between 1990 and 1994 in the United States was very high (92%); however, survival in black males was 7% lower compared with white males. The authors updated these findings and examined survival by stage and race. METHODS: The authors used data from the CONCORD-2 study for males (ages 15-99 years) who were diagnosed with prostate cancer in 37 states, covering 80% of the US population. Survival was adjusted for background mortality (net survival) using state-specific and race-specific life tables and was age-standardized. Data were presented for 2001 through 2003 and 2004 through 2009 to account for changes in collecting SEER Summary Stage 2000. RESULTS: Among the 1,527,602 prostate cancers diagnosed between 2001 and 2009, the proportion of localized cases increased from 73% to 77% in black males and from 77% to 79% in white males. Although the proportion of distant-stage cases was higher among black males than among white males, they represented less than 6% of cases in both groups between 2004 and 2009. Net survival exceeded 99% for localized stage between 2004 and 2009 in both racial groups. Overall, and in most states, 5-year net survival exceeded 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate cancer survival has increased since the first CONCORD study, and the racial gap has narrowed. Earlier detection of localized cancers likely contributed to this finding. However, racial disparities also were observed in overall survival. To help understand which factors might contribute to the persistence of this disparity, states could use local data to explore sociodemographic characteristics, such as survivors' health insurance status, health literacy, treatment decision-making processes, and treatment preferences.

BACKGROUND: Many patients with breast cancer work for pay at the time of their diagnosis, and the treatment plan may threaten their livelihood. Understanding work experiences in a contemporary population-based sample is necessary to inform initiatives to reduce the burden of cancer care. METHODS: Women who were 20 to 79 years old and had been diagnosed with stage 0 to II breast cancer, as reported to the Georgia and Los Angeles Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries in 2014-2015, were surveyed. Of the 3672 eligible women, 2502 responded (68%); 1006 who reported working before their diagnosis were analyzed. Multivariate models evaluated correlates of missing work for >1 month and stopping work altogether versus missing work for </=1 month. RESULTS: In this diverse sample, most patients (62%) underwent lumpectomy; 16% underwent unilateral mastectomy (8% with reconstruction); and 23% underwent bilateral mastectomy (19% with reconstruction). One-third (33%) received chemotherapy. Most (84%) worked full-time before their diagnosis; however, only 50% had paid sick leave, 39% had disability benefits, and 38% had flexible work schedules. Surgical treatment was strongly correlated with missing >1 month of work (odds ratio [OR] for bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction vs lumpectomy, 7.8) and with stopping work altogether (OR for bilateral mastectomy with reconstruction vs lumpectomy, 3.1). Chemotherapy receipt (OR for missing >1 month, 1.3; OR for stopping work altogether, 3.9) and race (OR for missing >1 month for blacks vs whites, 2.0; OR for stopping work altogether for blacks vs whites, 1.7) also correlated. Those with paid sick leave were less likely to stop working (OR, 0.5), as were those with flexible schedules (OR, 0.3). CONCLUSIONS: Working patients who received more aggressive treatments were more likely to experience substantial employment disruptions. Cancer 2017;123:4791-9. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Soy food intake may have protective effects against the risk for breast cancer, including estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: To evaluate the association of soy intake with the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and genes in the tumor tissue of patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC; ie, breast cancer lacking expression of ER, progesterone receptor, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2), the expression of 800 miRNAs and 302 genes were measured with NanoString nCounter assays in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissue from 272 TNBC patients. Soy intake during the 1-year period before the cancer diagnosis was assessed with a validated food-frequency questionnaire. The association of soy intake with the expression of miRNAs and genes was evaluated via linear regression analysis with adjustments for patient age and TNM stage. RESULTS: A total of 14 miRNAs and 24 genes were significantly associated with soy food intake (P < .05): Thirteen of the 14 miRNAs (92.9%) and 9 of the 24 genes (37.5%), including tumor suppressors miR-29a-3p and IGF1R, showed overexpression for those women with high soy intake, whereas the remaining miRNAs and genes, including oncogenes KRAS and FGFR4, showed underexpression. Furthermore, cell growth-related genes showed a predominantly underexpression pattern according to a comparison of tumor samples from women with high soy food intake and samples from women with lower soy food intake. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that long-term prediagnosis soy intake may lead to increased expression of tumor suppressors and decreased expression of oncogenes, especially cell growth-related genes, in breast tumor tissues.

BACKGROUND: Prostate cancer is highly influenced by androgens and genes. The authors investigated whether genetic polymorphisms along the androgen biosynthesis and metabolism pathways are associated with androgen concentrations or with the risk of prostate cancer or high-grade disease from finasteride treatment. METHODS: A nested case-control study from the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial using data from men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer (cases) and a group of biopsy-negative, frequency-matched controls was conducted to investigate the association of 51 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 12 genes of the androgen pathway with overall (total), low-grade, and high-grade prostate cancer incidence and serum hormone concentrations. RESULTS: There were significant associations of genetic polymorphisms in steroid 5alpha-reductase 1 (SRD5A1) (reference SNPs: rs3736316, rs3822430, rs1560149, rs248797, and rs472402) and SRD5A2 (rs2300700) with the risk of high-grade prostate cancer in the placebo arm of the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial; 2 SNPs were significantly associated with an increased risk (SRD5A1 rs472402 [odds ratio, 1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-2.75; Ptrend = .03] and SRD5A2 rs2300700 [odds ratio, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-3.18; Ptrend = .01]). Eleven SNPs in SRD5A1, SRD5A2, cytochrome P450 family 1, subfamily B, polypeptide 1 (CYP1B1), and CYP3A4 were associated with modifying the mean concentrations of serum androgen and sex hormone-binding globulin; and 2 SNPs (SRD5A1 rs824811 and CYP1B1 rs10012; Ptrend < .05) consistently and significantly altered all androgen concentrations. Several SNPs (SRD5A1 rs3822430, SRD5A2 rs2300700, CYP3A43 rs800672, and CYP19 rs700519; Ptrend < .05) were significantly associated with both circulating hormone levels and prostate cancer risk. CONCLUSIONS: Germline genetic variations of androgen-related pathway genes are associated with serum androgen concentrations and the risk of prostate cancer. Further studies to examine the functional consequence of novel causal variants are warranted. Cancer 2016;122:2332-2340. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used as a supplement to cancer therapy. Yet, their effect on cancer mortality is largely unknown. Using data from Danish nationwide registries and Cox models regressing of both propensity scores and drug use, we estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cancer-specific and noncancer death among PPI users (>/=2 prescriptions within six months after diagnosis; n = 36,066) compared with nonusers (<2 prescriptions, n = 311,853) or users of histamine H2 -receptor antagonists (H2 RA; n = 5,152). Adjusted HRs for cancer-specific mortality among postdiagnostic PPI users as compared with nonusers or H2 RA users were 1.29 (95% CI, 1.27-1.32) and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.10-1.20), respectively. HRs for cancer mortality associated with PPI use were highest for ovarian (1.35; 95% CI, 1.20-1.52) and lowest for esophageal cancer (0.91; 95% CI, 0.81-1.04). The associations were stronger among new PPI users after cancer diagnosis, indicating potential confounding. To test the effect of PPIs on tumor growth in a model system free for confounding factors, we investigated the effect of pantoprazole on tumor growth in mice. Pantoprazole (5 mg/kg/day) enhanced tumor growth (p = 0.033) and reduced the antitumor activity of gemcitabine (p = 0.008) in fibrosarcoma-bearing Balb/c mice, but not in immunodeficient Balb/c nude mice. In breast carcinoma-bearing FVB/N mice, pantoprazole had no effect on tumor growth alone but it reduced the life-prolonging effect of doxorubicin significantly (p = 0.007). Taken together, these data raise concerns about the increasing use of PPIs and calls for further studies addressing their safety among cancer patients.

Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) offer primary and preventive healthcare, including cancer screening, for the nation's most vulnerable population. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between access to FQHCs and cancer mortality-to-incidence ratios (MIRs). One-way analysis of variance was conducted to compare the mean MIRs for breast, cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancers for each U.S. county for 2006-2010 by access to FQHCs (direct access, in-county FQHC; indirect access, adjacent-county FQHC; no access, no FQHC either in the county or in adjacent counties). ArcMap 10.1 software was used to map cancer MIRs and FQHC access levels. The mean MIRs for breast, cervical, and prostate cancer differed significantly across FQHC access levels (p < 0.05). In urban and healthcare professional shortage areas, mean MIRs decreased as FQHC access increased. A trend of lower breast and prostate cancer MIRs in direct access to FQHCs was found for all racial groups, but this trend was significant for whites only. States with a large proportion of rural and medically underserved areas had high mean MIRs, with correspondingly more direct FQHC access. Expanding FQHCs to more underserved areas and concentrations of disparity populations may have an important role in reducing cancer morbidity and mortality, as well as racial-ethnic disparities, in the United States.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of smoking habit change on the risk of cancer. Materials and Methods: From the Korean National Health Insurance Service database, we determined the change in smoking habit between the first (2002 and 2003) and second (2004 and 2005) health examination periods. A total of 143,071 men were categorized into baseline heavy (>/= 20 cigarettes per day), moderate (10-19 cigarettes per day), light (< 10 cigarettes per day) smokers, quitters, and never smokers, after which the change in smoking status was determined during the second health examination. The participants were then followed up from 2006 to 2013 for all cancer, smoking related cancer, and lung cancer. RESULTS: Compared to heavy continual smokers, heavy smokers who quit had reduced risk of smoking related cancer (hazard ratio [HR], 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.97) and tended to have reduced risk of all cancer (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.00). Moderate smokers who reduced the amount of smoking to light levels had decreased risk of all cancer (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.72 to 0.94), smoking related cancer (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.93), and lung cancer (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.79) compared to heavy continual smokers. CONCLUSION: Smoking reduction decreases the risk of all cancer, smoking related cancer, and lung cancer. While smoking cessation should be the treatment of choice for smokers, smoking reduction may serve as an alternative strategy for those who cannot quit.

BACKGROUND: KIT-directed tyrosine kinase inhibitors such as imatinib have demonstrated benefits in KIT-mutant (KIT+) mucosal, acral, vulvovaginal, and chronically sun-damaged (CSD) melanoma. Dasatinib has superior preclinical activity in comparison with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors against cells with the most common KIT mutation, exon 11(L576P) . The ECOG-ACRIN E2607 trial assessed dasatinib in patients with these melanoma subtypes. METHODS: Patients received 70 mg of oral dasatinib twice daily. The primary objective for this 2-stage phase 2 trial was response rate. Stage I was open to KIT+ and wild-type KIT (KIT-) mucosal, acral, and CSD melanoma (n = 57). Stage II accrued only KIT+ tumors (n = 30). To enrich the trial for KIT+ tumors, vulvovaginal melanoma was added, and CSD melanoma was removed from eligibility. Secondary objectives included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. RESULTS: From May 2009 to December 2010, the first stage enrolled 57 patients. Among the evaluable patients, 3 of 51 (5.9%) achieved a partial response: all were KIT-. Stage II closed early because of slow accrual (November 2011 to December 2015). In stage II, 4 of 22 evaluable patients (18.2%) had a partial response; the median duration was 4.2 months. The median PFS was 2.1 months (n = 73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-2.9 months). The median OS was 7.5 months (95% CI, 6.0-11.9 months). In exploratory analyses, no differences were seen in PFS or OS with the KIT status or subtype. Dasatinib was discontinued because of adverse events in 9 of 75 patients (12%). CONCLUSIONS: The dasatinib response rate among KIT+ melanoma patients was low. In view of its clinical activity, it is recommended that imatinib remain the KIT tyrosine kinase inhibitor of choice for unresectable KIT+ melanoma. Cancer 2017;123:2688-97.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. In China, the incidence of lung cancer has grown rapidly, resulting in a large social and economic burden. Several researchers have devoted their studies to lung cancer and have demonstrated that there are many risk factors for lung cancer in China, including tobacco use, environmental pollution, food, genetics, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, the lung cancer incidence is still growing rapidly in China, and there is an even higher incidence among the younger generation. One explanation may be the triple-neglect situation, in which medical policies that neglect prevention, diagnosis, and supportive care have increased patients' mortality and reduced their quality of life. Therefore, it is necessary to enhance the efficiency of prevention and early diagnosis not only by focusing more attention on treatment but also by drawing more attention to supportive care for patients with lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Knowledge about disease and treatment is necessary before patients can consent to treatment. One of the few established instruments for evaluating whether sufficient information has been provided, is the EORTC QLQ-INFO25 questionnaire which was developed to measure how patients perceive information. The aim of this study was to investigate whether cancer patients' level of knowledge about their disease and treatment was associated with their perception of and satisfaction with the information. METHODS: Breast cancer patients referred for adjuvant chemotherapy and prostate cancer patients referred for curative radiotherapy were included. Level of knowledge about their disease and treatment was measured using study-specific questionnaires. Patients' perception of and satisfaction with the received information was assessed using EORTC QLQ-INFO25. Assessments were done before the first consultation with an oncologist (T1), after the consultation (T2) and 8 weeks after start of treatment (T3). RESULTS: Ninety eight patients were enrolled. Patients with higher education, daily Internet access and in paid employment had the highest baseline knowledge scores. The mean knowledge score increased significantly (T1: 16.4; T2: 20.8; T3: 21.3; p < 0.001.). During the same period, the patients reported on the INFO25 a significant, positive increase in how much information they had received, and that they were more satisfied with the information. CONCLUSIONS: Patients' knowledge increased significantly during the study period, and they reported that they felt better informed and were more satisfied with the information, suggesting that EORTC QLQ-INFO25 might be used to evaluate cancer patients' level of knowledge about their disease and treatment.

Objective: To compare the clinicopathological characteristics of second primary lung cancer following breast cancer and lung metastases from breast cancer, and then to analyze the risk factors in breast cancer patients with second primary lung tumor. Methods: Clinical data of 55 breast cancer patients with second primary lung tumor and 205 breast cancer patients with solitary pulmonary metastasis in Shandong Cancer Hospital from January 2006 to January 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. The risk factors of primary lung cancer following breast cancer were analyzed using logistic regression model. Results: Second primary lung cancer in patients with first breast cancer accounted for approximately 21.2%(55/260) of pulmonary malignant solitary nodules, and 0.84%(55/6 580) of all breast cancer patients. The median intervals between the diagnosis of second primary lung cancer or lung metastasis and first breast cancer were 52 months and 42 months, respectively. These two groups showed significant difference between age, time interval between diagnoses, breast tumor size, axillary lymph node metastasis, estrogen receptor, molecular subtype (luminal B and triple-negative) and history of radiotherapy (P<0.05 for all). A multivariate logistic regression model confirmed that age (OR=1.088, P<0.001), breast tumor size(OR=0.480, P<0.001), and radiotherapy history (OR=3.460, P=0.004) were all independent factors for second primary lung cancer. Conclusions: For isolated pulmonary nodules in patients with breast cancer, especially for those with elder age, larger tumor size and radiotherapy history, we should distinguish the second primary lung cancer from pulmonary metastasis. The treatment regimen for lung metastasis and primary lung cancer in patients with breast cancer are entirely distinct. The timely histopathology examinations for pulmonary nodes in patients with breast cancer are recommended.

Background: From most recent available data, we predicted cancer mortality statistics in selected Latin American countries for the year 2017, with focus on lung cancer. Materials and methods: We obtained death certification data from the World Health Organization and population data from the Pan American Health Organization database for all neoplasms and selected cancer sites. We derived figures for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Cuba, Mexico and Venezuela. Using a logarithmic Poisson count data joinpoint model, we estimated number of deaths and age-standardized (world population) mortality rates in 2017. Results: Total cancer mortality rates are predicted to decline in all countries. The highest mortality rates for 2017 are in Cuba, i.e. 132.3/100 000 men and 93.3/100 000 women. Mexico had the lowest predicted rates, 64.7/100 000 men and 60.6/100 000 women. In contrast, the total number of cancer deaths is expected to rise due to population ageing and growth. Men showed declines in lung cancer trends in all countries and age groups considered, while only Colombian and Mexican women had downward trends. Stomach and (cervix) uteri rates are predicted to continue their declines, though mortality from these neoplasms remains comparatively high. Colorectal, breast and prostate cancer rates were predicted to decline moderately, as well as leukaemias. There was no clear pattern for pancreatic cancer. Between 1990 and 2017 about 420 000 cancer deaths were avoided in 5 of the 7 countries, no progress was observed in Brazil and Cuba. Conclusion: Cancer mortality rates for 2017 in seven selected Latin American countries are predicted to decline, though there was appreciable variability across countries. Mortality from major cancers-including lung and prostate-and all cancers remains comparatively high in Cuba, indicating the need for improved prevention and management.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is a disease that affects mostly older adults. Older adults often have other chronic health conditions in addition to cancer and may have different health priorities, both of which can impact cancer treatment decision-making. However, no systematic review of factors that influence an older cancer patient's decision to accept or decline cancer treatment has been conducted. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Systematic review of the literature published between inception of the databases and February 2013. Dutch, English, French or German articles reporting on qualitative studies, cross-sectional, longitudinal observational or intervention studies describing factors why older adults accepted or declined cancer treatment examining actual treatment decisions were included. Ten databases were used. Two independent reviewers reviewed manuscripts and performed data abstraction using a standardized form and the quality of studies was assessed with the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. RESULTS: Of 17,343 abstracts reviewed, a total of 38 studies were included. The majority focused on breast and prostate cancer treatment decisions and most studies used a qualitative design. Important factors for accepting treatment were convenience and success rate of treatment, seeing necessity of treatment, trust in the physician and following the physician's recommendation. Factors important for declining cancer treatment included concerns about the discomfort of the treatments, fear of side effects and transportation difficulties. CONCLUSION: Although the reasons why older adults with cancer accepted or declined treatment varied considerably, the most consistent determinant was physician recommendation. Further studies using large, representative samples and exploring decision-making incorporating health literacy and comorbidity are needed.

BACKGROUND: With growing concerns about risk of harm from cancer screening, particularly from overdiagnosis, this study aimed to assess public attitudes to cancer screening in Great Britain. METHODS: We used a population-based survey to assess attitudes to cancer screening, screening history and demographic characteristics, in men and women aged 50-80 years. Data were collected using face-to-face computer-assisted interviews in 2012. RESULTS: In our sample of 2024, attitudes to cancer screening were overwhelmingly positive with almost 90% believing that screening is 'almost always a good idea' and 49% saying they would be tested for cancer even if it was untreatable. Attitudes were particularly positive among those who had previously taken part in breast or colorectal screening. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that attitudes to cancer screening are very positive in Great Britain. Widespread enthusiasm for cancer screening may hamper attempts to encourage a greater appreciation of the limitations and potential harms of screening.

Anti-programmed death (PD)-1 agents pembrolizumab and nivolumab have recently obtained enthusiastic results in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) and tolerability in cancer patients. Despite these promising data, the high cost of these agents needs careful consideration. Indeed, the evaluation of cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and quality-adjusted life year (QALY), as well as different drug reimbursement modalities, will represent fundamental tools in order to guarantee the economic sustainability of health system and the access to care for all cancer patients. In this review, we discussed the recent results obtained by immunotherapy in cancer patients and we evaluated the economic impact of recently approved nivolumab and pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

BACKGROUND: Monitoring cancer risk among HIV-infected people in the modern antiretroviral therapy (ART) era is essential given their elevated risk for many cancers and prolonged survival with immunosuppression, ART exposure, and ageing. We aimed to examine cancer risk in HIV-infected people in the USA as compared with that in the general population. METHODS: We did a registry-linkage study with data from population-based HIV and cancer registries in the USA (the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study). We assessed a cohort of HIV-infected people identified in HIV registries in Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Puerto Rico, and Texas from 1996 to 2012. Follow-up started 3 months after either the latest of the beginning of systematic name-based state HIV registration, HIV report date (or AIDS diagnosis, if this was earlier), start of cancer registration, or Jan 1, 1996, and ended at the earliest of either death, end of cancer-registry coverage, or Dec 31, 2012. We identified diagnoses of cancer in this population through linkage with corresponding cancer registries and calculated standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) to measure cancer risk in people with HIV compared with the USA general population, by dividing the observed number of cases in people with HIV by the expected number (estimated by applying general population cancer-incidence rates to person-time in the HIV population based on sex, age, race or ethnic group, calendar year, and registry). We tested SIR differences by AIDS status and over time using Poisson regression. FINDINGS: Among 448 258 people with HIV (who contributed 3 093 033 person-years), 21 294 incident cancers were diagnosed during 1996-2012. In these people, compared with the general population, risk was elevated (p<0.0001 for all) for cancer overall (SIR 1.69, 95% CI 1.67-1.72), AIDS-defining cancers (Kaposi's sarcoma [498.11, 477.82-519.03], non-Hodgkin lymphoma [11.51, 11.14-11.89], and cervix [3.24, 2.94-3.56]), most other virus-related cancers (eg, anus [19.06, 18.13-20.03], liver [3.21, 3.02-3.41], and Hodgkin's lymphoma [7.70, 7.20-8.23]), and some virus-unrelated cancers (eg, lung [1.97, 1.89-2.05]), but not for other common cancers. Risk for several cancers was higher after AIDS onset and declined across calendar periods. After multivariable adjustment, SIRs decreased significantly across 1996-2012 for Kaposi's sarcoma, two subtypes of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and cancer of the anus, liver, and lung, but remained elevated. SIRs did not increase over time for any cancer. INTERPRETATION: For several virus-related cancers and lung cancer, declining risks over time in HIV-infected people probably reflect the expansion of ART since 1996. Additional efforts aimed at cancer prevention and screening in people with HIV are warranted. FUNDING: National Cancer Institute.

BACKGROUND: The rarity of mutations in PALB2, CHEK2 and ATM make it difficult to estimate precisely associated cancer risks. Population-based family studies have provided evidence that at least some of these mutations are associated with breast cancer risk as high as those associated with rare BRCA2 mutations. We aimed to estimate the relative risks associated with specific rare variants in PALB2, CHEK2 and ATM via a multicentre case-control study. METHODS: We genotyped 10 rare mutations using the custom iCOGS array: PALB2 c.1592delT, c.2816T>G and c.3113G>A, CHEK2 c.349A>G, c.538C>T, c.715G>A, c.1036C>T, c.1312G>T, and c.1343T>G and ATM c.7271T>G. We assessed associations with breast cancer risk (42 671 cases and 42 164 controls), as well as prostate (22 301 cases and 22 320 controls) and ovarian (14 542 cases and 23 491 controls) cancer risk, for each variant. RESULTS: For European women, strong evidence of association with breast cancer risk was observed for PALB2 c.1592delT OR 3.44 (95% CI 1.39 to 8.52, p=7.1x10(-5)), PALB2 c.3113G>A OR 4.21 (95% CI 1.84 to 9.60, p=6.9x10(-8)) and ATM c.7271T>G OR 11.0 (95% CI 1.42 to 85.7, p=0.0012). We also found evidence of association with breast cancer risk for three variants in CHEK2, c.349A>G OR 2.26 (95% CI 1.29 to 3.95), c.1036C>T OR 5.06 (95% CI 1.09 to 23.5) and c.538C>T OR 1.33 (95% CI 1.05 to 1.67) (p</=0.017). Evidence for prostate cancer risk was observed for CHEK2 c.1343T>G OR 3.03 (95% CI 1.53 to 6.03, p=0.0006) for African men and CHEK2 c.1312G>T OR 2.21 (95% CI 1.06 to 4.63, p=0.030) for European men. No evidence of association with ovarian cancer was found for any of these variants. CONCLUSIONS: This report adds to accumulating evidence that at least some variants in these genes are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer that is clinically important.

BACKGROUND: Surgical resection with adjuvant chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with pancreatic cancer, but to the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the temporal relationship between chemotherapy initiation and survival. The current study analyzed the impact of time to the initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base (2003-2011) was retrospectively reviewed for patients with clinical American Joint Committee on Cancer stages I to III resected pancreatic carcinoma. Time to chemotherapy was stratified at the 12-week postoperative time point. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: The current study included 6706 patients who underwent surgical resection alone, 3723 patients who initiated adjuvant chemotherapy at </=12 weeks, and 669 patients who initiated adjuvant chemotherapy at >12 weeks. Patients who received chemotherapy at >12 weeks were older and had greater comorbidities. Those undergoing a Whipple resection or total pancreatectomy were more likely to initiate chemotherapy later compared with those patients undergoing a distal surgical resection. Adjuvant chemotherapy conferred a survival benefit over surgical resection alone (P<.0001). There was no overall survival benefit observed for patients receiving adjuvant chemotherapy at </=12 weeks compared with at >12 weeks (P =.5301). When stratified by pathological stage of disease, there was no survival benefit noted for the earlier initiation of chemotherapy: stage I: P =.2783; stage II: P =.0708; and stage III: P =.0778. After controlling for patient, disease, and surgery characteristics, both patients who initiated adjuvant chemotherapy at </=12 weeks and at >12 weeks were found to have a 35% lower odds of mortality versus those who underwent surgical resection alone (P<.0001 for both). CONCLUSIONS: The earlier initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to significantly impact long-term survival in patients with resected pancreatic cancer. Because adjuvant chemotherapy confers a survival benefit, delayed chemotherapy should be offered when appropriate. Cancer 2016;122:2979-2987. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

Objective: To explore the sustainability of cancer screening strategy from potential demander's perspective in Chinese country, we conducted a study on the use of cancer screening services and willingness-to-pay among the urban community residents. All the participants of this study had not been on the Cancer Screening Program in Urban China (CanSPUC) or any other national level cancer screening projects. Methods: Target communities and populations were selected from the 16 project provinces in China which were on the program between 2014 and 2015, by using the multi-center cross-sectional convenience sampling method. Chi-square was used to compare the rates on the utilization of service and willingness-to-pay across the different subgroups. Logistic progression was conducted to examine factors that associated with the service utilization and willingness-to-pay. Results: A total of 16 394 participants were included in this study. Among them, 12.1% (1 984/16 394) had ever been on a cancer screening program. Populations with following characteristics as: being elderly (60-69 years, OR=1.27, 95% CI: 1.13-1.43), female (male, OR= 0.56, 95%CI: 0.50-0.62), having had higher education (high school/specialized secondary school, OR= 1.51, 95%CI: 1.35-1.70; college or over, OR=2.10, 95%CI: 1.36-3.25), working for public (OR=2.85, 95% CI: 2.26-3.59), enterprises or self-employed agencies (OR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.06-1.64), having higher income (60 000-150 000 Chinese Yuan, OR=1.55, 95%CI: 1.39-1.73; >/=150 000 Chinese Yuan, OR=2.57, 95% CI: 2.09-3.15), under basic medical insurance programs for urban employees/for government servants'(OR=1.15, 95% CI: 1.01-1.32), on basic medical insurance set for urban residents'/on commercial medical insurance programs etc. (OR=1.01, 95%CI: 0.84-1.22), were in favor of the services. When neglecting the fee for charge, 65.8% (10 795/16 394) of the participants said that they could accept the cancer screening program, particularly in those who had already been on the screening program (P<0.05). 61.2% (10 038/16 392) of all the participants showed the willingness-topay for a long-term packaging screening services, particularly in those who were relatively younger (60-69 years, OR=0.80, 95%CI: 0.74-0.87), working for public (OR=1.76, 95%CI: 1.56-1.98) or enterprise sectors or self-employed households (OR=1.32, 95%CI: 1.18-1.47), having higher income (60 000-150 000 Chinese Yuan, OR=1.51, 95%CI: 1.40-1.63; >/=150 000 Chinese Yuan,OR= 1.95, 95% CI: 1.60-2.38), utilized screening services (OR=2.18, 95% CI: 1.94-2.46). Conclusions: The rate of using the cancer screening services should be improved. Factors including age, gender, education, occupation, income and insurance appeared as major factors related to the use of cancer screening services. Willingness-to-pay seemed relatively high, but the amount of payment they could afford was limited. Factors including age, occupation, income and insurance appeared as major factors to the willingness-to-pay.

BACKGROUND: Soy foods possess both antiestrogenic and estrogen-like properties. It remains controversial whether women diagnosed with breast cancer should be advised to eat more or less soy foods, especially for those who receive hormone therapies as part of cancer treatment. METHODS: The association of dietary intake of isoflavone, the major phytoestrogen in soy, with all-cause mortality was examined in 6235 women with breast cancer enrolled in the Breast Cancer Family Registry. Dietary intake was assessed using a Food Frequency Questionnaire developed for the Hawaii-Los Angeles Multiethnic Cohort among 5178 women who reported prediagnosis diet and 1664 women who reported postdiagnosis diet. Cox proportional-hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 113 months (approximately 9.4 years), 1224 deaths were documented. A 21% decrease was observed in all-cause mortality for women who had the highest versus lowest quartile of dietary isoflavone intake (>/=1.5 vs < 0.3 mg daily: HR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval CI, 0.64-0.97; Ptrend = .01). Lower mortality associated with higher intake was limited to women who had tumors that were negative for hormone receptors (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29-0.83; Ptrend = .005) and those who did not receive hormone therapy for their breast cancer (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.91; Ptrend = .02). Interactions, however, did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, ethnically diverse cohort of women with breast cancer living in North America, a higher dietary intake of isoflavone was associated with reduced all-cause mortality.

Prostate, breast and colorectal cancer are the most common tumours in Spain. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between adherence to nutrition-based guidelines for cancer prevention and prostate, breast and colorectal cancer, in the MCC-Spain case-control study. A total of 1,718 colorectal, 1,343 breast and 864 prostate cancer cases and 3,431 population-based controls recruited between 2007 and 2012, were included in the present study. The World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRC/AICR) score based on six recommendations for cancer prevention (on body fatness, physical activity, foods and drinks that promote weight gain, plant foods, animal foods and alcoholic drinks; score range 0-6) was constructed. We used unconditional logistic regression analysis adjusting for potential confounders. One-point increment in the WCRF/AICR score was associated with 25% (95% CI 19-30%) lower risk of colorectal, and 15% (95% CI 7-22%) lower risk of breast cancer; no association with prostate cancer was detected, except for cases with a Gleason score >/=7 (poorly differentiated/undifferentiated tumours) (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.76-0.99). These results add to the wealth of evidence indicating that a great proportion of common cancer cases could be avoided by adopting healthy lifestyle habits.

CONTEXT: Thyroid hormones regulate cellular survival and metabolism; however, their association with cancer incidence and death has not been well explored. OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to examine the relationship between thyrotropin (TSH) and free thyroxine (FT4) with cancer incidence (all cancers, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer). Associations with cancer-related deaths were also explored. DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective cohort study involving community-dwelling men aged 70-89 years. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Thyroid hormones were measured in 3836 men between 2001 and 2004. Competing risks analyses were used to perform longitudinal analyses with results expressed as subhazard ratios (SHR). Outcomes were ascertained through electronic linkage until 20 June 2013. RESULTS: Mean age was 77.0 +/- 3.6 years. A total of 864 men developed cancers, and 506 experienced cancer-related deaths. A total of 340, 136 and 119 men developed prostate, colorectal and lung cancers, respectively. After adjustments, there were no associations between TSH and incidence of all cancers, prostate or lung cancer. Higher TSH was associated with increased colorectal cancer incidence (SHR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.00-1.42; P = 0.048 for every 1 SD increase in log TSH). This association was strengthened after excluding the first year of follow-up (SHR = 1.23, 95% CI 1.02-1.48, P = 0.028). FT4 was not associated with incidence of all cancers, prostate, colorectal or lung cancer. Thyroid hormones were not associated with cancer-related deaths. CONCLUSION: In community-dwelling older men, FT4 was not associated with cancer incidence. Higher TSH is independently associated with increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Further investigation is warranted to determine whether a causal relationship exists.

BACKGROUND: There is a persistent racial survival disparity between African American (AA) and white women with breast cancer. There is evidence that symptom incidence, associated distress, and overall cancer-related distress may be unexplored, important contributing factors. The purpose of the current study was to: 1) describe and compare the number of chemotherapy-related symptoms and associated distress among AA women with breast cancer over the course of chemotherapy at 3 time points (at baseline before initiating chemotherapy, midpoint, and at the completion of chemotherapy); and 2) to describe the relationship between the number of chemotherapy-related symptoms and overall cancer distress compared with the ability to receive at least 85% of the prescribed chemotherapy within the prescribed timeframe. METHODS: Descriptive, comparative, and correlational analyses of symptom incidence, symptom distress, cancer-related distress, and prescribed chemotherapy dose received among a cohort of AA women receiving chemotherapy for breast cancer were performed. RESULTS: AA women (121 women) experienced worsening symptoms from baseline to midpoint in chemotherapy and then stabilized for the duration of therapy. The inability to receive 85% of the prescribed chemotherapy within a prescribed time point was found to be significantly correlated with midpoint symptom distress. CONCLUSIONS: The main findings of the current study were that AA women experience a deterioration in symptom distress over the course of chemotherapy from baseline (before chemotherapy) to the midpoint, which was found to be associated with less adherence to chemotherapy overall. Thus, the incidence and management of physical and emotional symptoms, as measured through a multidimensional symptom measurement tool, may be contributing to breast cancer dose disparity and should be explored further.

BACKGROUND: The World Wide Web has emerged as a powerful data source for epidemiological studies related to infectious disease surveillance. However, its potential for cancer-related epidemiological discoveries is largely unexplored. METHODS: Using advanced web crawling and tailored information extraction procedures, the authors automatically collected and analyzed the text content of 79 394 online obituary articles published between 1998 and 2014. The collected data included 51 911 cancer (27 330 breast; 9470 lung; 6496 pancreatic; 6342 ovarian; 2273 colon) and 27 483 non-cancer cases. With the derived information, the authors replicated a case-control study design to investigate the association between parity (i.e., childbearing) and cancer risk. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated for each cancer type and compared to those reported in large-scale epidemiological studies. RESULTS: Parity was found to be associated with a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer (OR = 0.78, 95% CI, 0.75-0.82), pancreatic cancer (OR = 0.78, 95% CI, 0.72-0.83), colon cancer (OR = 0.67, 95% CI, 0.60-0.74), and ovarian cancer (OR = 0.58, 95% CI, 0.54-0.62). Marginal association was found for lung cancer risk (OR = 0.87, 95% CI, 0.81-0.92). The linear trend between increased parity and reduced cancer risk was dramatically more pronounced for breast and ovarian cancer than the other cancers included in the analysis. CONCLUSION: This large web-mining study on parity and cancer risk produced findings very similar to those reported with traditional observational studies. It may be used as a promising strategy to generate study hypotheses for guiding and prioritizing future epidemiological studies.

Emerging evidence has indicated that apoptotic cells have a compensatory effect on the proliferation of neighboring cells. Recent studies have shown that apoptotic tumor cells stimulate the repopulation of tumors from a small number of surviving cells by cleaved caspase-3 regulation and elevated tumor cleaved (and thus activated) caspase-3 expression levels predict worse treatment outcomes in cancer patients. The prognostic significance of cleaved caspase-3 should be demonstrated in more human cancer types and larger subjects. Here, we examined the cleaved caspase-3 expression in 367 human tumor samples (gastric cancer: 97 cases, ovarian cancer: 65 cases, cervical cancer: 104 cases; colorectal cancer: 101 cases) with immunohistochemistry (IHC) and the relationship between the expression of cleaved caspase-3 and various clinicopathological factors were also detected. We found that, cleaved caspase-3 was significantly associated with pathological risk factors (P < 0.005) for the studied cancers, such as tumor stage, lymph-node metastasis, differentiation and so on. In univariate and multivariate analysis, patients with high expression of cleaved caspase-3 had a significant shorter overall survival time compared with those with low cleaved caspase-3 expression in gastric cancer (P < 0.001), ovarian cancer (P < 0.001), cervical cancer (P = 0.002), colorectal cancer (P < 0.001) individually and in the patients combined (P < 0.001). Cox regression results suggested cleaved caspase-3 as an independent prognosis predictor for the studied four cancer types. Our study showed cleaved caspase-3 was well correlated to progression, aggressive behaviors in the studied cancer, and implicated it as a potential predictive factor for the prognosis of the four cancer types. It also indicated cleaved caspase-3 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: The occurrence of subsequent neoplasms has direct impact on the quantity and quality of life in cancer survivors. We have expanded our analysis of these events in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) to better understand the occurrence of these events as the survivor population ages. METHODS: The incidence of and risk for subsequent neoplasms occurring 5 years or more after the childhood cancer diagnosis were determined among 14,359 5-year survivors in the CCSS who were treated from 1970 through 1986 and who were at a median age of 30 years (range = 5-56 years) for this analysis. At 30 years after childhood cancer diagnosis, we calculated cumulative incidence at 30 years of subsequent neoplasms and calculated standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), excess absolute risks (EARs) for invasive second malignant neoplasms, and relative risks for subsequent neoplasms by use of multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: Among 14,359 5-year survivors, 1402 subsequently developed 2703 neoplasms. Cumulative incidence at 30 years after the childhood cancer diagnosis was 20.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 19.1% to 21.8%) for all subsequent neoplasms, 7.9% (95% CI = 7.2% to 8.5%) for second malignant neoplasms (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer), 9.1% (95% CI = 8.1% to 10.1%) for nonmelanoma skin cancer, and 3.1% (95% CI = 2.5% to 3.8%) for meningioma. Excess risk was evident for all primary diagnoses (EAR = 2.6 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI = 2.4 to 2.9 per 1000 person-years; SIR = 6.0, 95% CI = 5.5 to 6.4), with the highest being for Hodgkin lymphoma (SIR = 8.7, 95% CI = 7.7 to 9.8) and Ewing sarcoma (SIR = 8.5, 95% CI = 6.2 to 11.7). In the Poisson multivariable analysis, female sex, older age at diagnosis, earlier treatment era, diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma, and treatment with radiation therapy were associated with increased risk of subsequent neoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: As childhood cancer survivors progress through adulthood, risk of subsequent neoplasms increases. Patients surviving Hodgkin lymphoma are at greatest risk. There is no evidence of risk reduction with increasing duration of follow-up.

All the currently available cancer therapeutic options are expensive but none of them are safe. However, traditional plant-derived medicines or compounds are relatively safe. One widely known such compound is beta-sitosterol (BS), a plant derived nutrient with anticancer properties against breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, stomach cancer, ovarian cancer, and leukemia. Studies have shown that BS interfere with multiple cell signaling pathways, including cell cycle, apoptosis, proliferation, survival, invasion, angiogenesis, metastasis and inflammation. Most of the studies are incomplete partly due to the fact that BS is relatively less potent. But the fact that it is generally considered as nontoxic, the opposite of all currently available cancer chemo-therapeutics, is missed by almost all research communities. To offset the lower efficacy of BS, designing BS delivery for "cancer cell specific" therapy hold huge potential. Delivery of BS through liposome is one of such demonstrations that has shown to be highly promising. But further research did not progress neither in the field of drug delivery of BS nor in the field on how BS mediated anticancer activities could be improved, thus making BS an orphan nutraceutical. Therefore, extensive research with BS as potent anticancer nutraceutical is highly recommended.

An increasing body of evidence suggests an association between cancer and atrial fibrillation (AF). The exact magnitude and underlying mechanism of this association are however unclear. Cancer-related inflammation, anti-cancer treatment and other cancer-related comorbidities are proposed to affect atrial remodelling, increasing the susceptibility of cancer patients for developing AF. Moreover, cancer is assumed to modify the risk of thromboembolisms and bleeding. A thorough and adequate understanding of these risks is however lacking, as current literature is scarce and show ambiguous results in AF patients. The standardized risk-models that normally aid the clinician in the decision of initiating anticoagulant therapy do not take the presence of malignancy into account. Other factors that complicate risk assessment in AF patients with cancer include drug-drug interactions and other cancer-related comorbidities such as renal impairment. In this review, we highlight the available literature regarding epidemiological association, risk assessment and anticoagulation therapy in AF patients with cancer.

OBJECTIVE: The abnormal expression of the key enzymes in glycolytic pathways, including glucose transporter-1, glucose transporter-3, hexokinase-II, lactate dehydrogenase 5, pyruvate kinase M2, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, transketolase-like protein 1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 was reported to be associated with poor prognosis of various cancers. However, the association remains controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of glycolysis-related proteins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, using Pubmed and Ovid as search engines and Google Scholar from inception to April 2017. Eighty-six studies with 12,002 patients were included in the study. RESULTS: Our pooled results identified that glycolysis-related proteins in cancers were associated with shorter overall survival of colorectal cancer (HR 2.33, 95% CI 1.38-3.93, P = 0.002), gastric cancer (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31-1.82, P < 0.001), cancer of gallbladder or bile duct (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.70-2.75, P < 0.001), oral cancer (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.32-3.25, P < 0.001), esophageal cancer (HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.25-2.21, P = 0.01), hepatocellular carcinoma (HR 2.04, 95% CI 1.64-2.54, P < 0.001), pancreatic cancer (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.39-2.13, P < 0.001), breast cancer(HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.34-2.08, P < 0.001), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (HR 3.59, 95% CI 1.75-7.36, P < 0.001). No association was found for lung cancer, ovarian cancer or melanoma. The key glycolytic transcriptional regulators (HIF-1alpha, p53) were analyzed in parallel to the glycolysis-related proteins, and the pooled results identified that high-level expression of HIF-1alpha was significantly associated with shorter overall survival (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.42-0.79, P < 0.001) Furthermore, glycolysis-related proteins linked with poor differentiated tumors (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.46-2.25, P < 0.001), positive lymph node metastasis (OR 2.73, 95% CI 2.16-3.46, P < 0.001), positive vascular invasion (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.37-3.07, P < 0.001), large tumor size (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.80-2.37, P < 0.001), advanced tumor stage (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.19-2.09, P < 0.001), and deeper invasion (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.93-2.91, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Glycolytic transcriptional regulators and glycolysis-related proteins in cancers were significantly associated with poor prognosis, suggesting glycolytic status may be potentially valuable prognostic biomarkers for various cancers.

Background: Patients who receive an abnormal cancer screening result require follow-up for diagnostic testing, but the time to follow-up varies across patients and practices.Methods: We used a simulation study to estimate the change in lifetime screening benefits when time to follow-up for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers was increased. Estimates were based on four independently developed microsimulation models that each simulated the life course of adults eligible for breast (women ages 50-74 years), cervical (women ages 21-65 years), or colorectal (adults ages 50-75 years) cancer screening. We assumed screening based on biennial mammography for breast cancer, triennial Papanicolaou testing for cervical cancer, and annual fecal immunochemical testing for colorectal cancer. For each cancer type, we simulated diagnostic testing immediately and at 3, 6, and 12 months after an abnormal screening exam.Results: We found declines in screening benefit with longer times to diagnostic testing, particularly for breast cancer screening. Compared to immediate diagnostic testing, testing at 3 months resulted in reduced screening benefit, with fewer undiscounted life years gained per 1,000 screened (breast: 17.3%, cervical: 0.8%, colorectal: 2.0% and 2.7%, from two colorectal cancer models), fewer cancers prevented (cervical: 1.4% fewer, colorectal: 0.5% and 1.7% fewer, respectively), and, for breast and colorectal cancer, a less favorable stage distribution.Conclusions: Longer times to diagnostic testing after an abnormal screening test can decrease screening effectiveness, but the impact varies substantially by cancer type.Impact: Understanding the impact of time to diagnostic testing on screening effectiveness can help inform quality improvement efforts.

In 2017, 10 topics were selected as major clinical research advances in gynecologic oncology. For cervical cancer, efficacy and safety analysis results of a 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine and long-term impact of reduced dose of quadrivalent vaccine were updated. Brief introduction of KEYNOTE trials of pembrolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the interaction between programmed death (PD)-1 and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, followed. Tailored surveillance programs for gynecologic cancer related with Lynch syndrome and update on sentinel lymph node mapping were reviewed for uterine corpus cancer. For ovarian cancer, 5 topics were selected including poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases inhibitors and immunotherapy. The other potential practice changers covered in this review were lymphadenectomy in advanced disease, secondary cytoreductive surgery in recurrent disease, weekly dose-dense regimen for first-line chemotherapy, incorporation of bevacizumab maintenance in platinum-sensitive recurrent disease, and effect of platinum-free interval prolongation. Conflicting opinions of academic societies on periodic pelvic examination were introduced in conjunction with relevant literature review. For the field of radiation oncology, results of 2 big trials, The Postoperative Radiation Therapy in Endometrial Carcinoma-3 and Gynecologic Oncology Group-258, for endometrial cancer and recent advance in high-dose-rate brachytherapy for cervical cancer were reported. Topics for breast cancer covered adjuvant capecitabine after preoperative chemotherapy, adjuvant pertuzumab and trastuzumab in early human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive disease, olaparib for metastatic cancer in patients with a germline BRCA mutation, 20-year risks of recurrence after stopping endocrine therapy at 5 years, and contemporary hormonal contraception and the risk of breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have suggested that esophagectomy is severely underused for patients with resectable esophageal cancer. The recent expansion of endoscopic local therapies, advances in surgical techniques, and improved postoperative outcomes have changed the therapeutic landscape. The impact of these developments and evolving treatment guidelines on national practice patterns is unknown. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with clinical stage 0 to III esophageal cancer were identified from the National Cancer Database (2004-2013). The receipt of potentially curative surgical treatment over time was analyzed, and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with surgical treatment. RESULTS: The analysis included 52,122 patients. From 2004 to 2013, the overall rate of potentially curative surgical treatment increased from 36.4% to 47.4% (P < .001). For stage 0 disease, the receipt of esophagectomy decreased from 23.8% to 17.9% (P < .001), whereas the use of local therapies increased from 34.3% to 58.8% (P < .001). The use of surgical treatment increased from 43.4% to 61.8% (P < .001), from 36.1% to 45.0% (P < .001), and from 30.8% to 38.6% (P < .001) for patients with stage I, II, and III disease, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, divergent practice patterns and adherence to national guidelines were noted between academic and community facilities. CONCLUSIONS: The use of potentially curative surgical treatment has increased for patients with stage 0 to III esophageal cancer. The expansion of local therapies has driven increased rates of surgical treatment for early-stage disease. Although the increased use of esophagectomy for more advanced disease is encouraging, significant variation persists at the patient and facility levels. Cancer 2017;123:410-419.

In the past decade, the study of mechanisms of cancer immunity has seen a prominent boom, which paralleled the increased amount of research on the clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in several lethal types of cancers. This conspicuous effort has led to the development of successful immunotherapy treatment strategies, whose medical impact has been recognized by the awarding of 2018 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to the two pioneers of check point inhibitor research, Tasuku Honjo and James Allison. Despite these promising achievements, the differences in the clinical response rate in different cancer patients and the high risk of toxicity of immune-based therapies represent crucial challenges. More remarkably, the causes responsible for different outcome (success vs failure) in patients with tumor having same histotype and clinical characteristics remain mostly unknown. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small regulatory noncoding RNA molecules representing the most studied component of the dark matter of the human genome, are involved in the regulation of many pathways of cancer and immune cells. Therefore, understanding the role of miRNAs in controlling cancer immunity is necessary, as it can contribute to reveal mechanisms that can be modulated to improve the success of immunetherapy in cancer patients. Here, we discuss the latest findings on immune pathways regulated by miRNAs in cancer, miRNA-mediated regulation of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, and miRNAs as potential target for immunotherapies.

The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer remains controversial. Here we review the current use of breast MRI and the impact of MRI on short-term surgical outcomes and rates of local recurrence. In addition, we address the use of MRI in specific patient populations, such as those with ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive lobular carcinoma, and occult primary breast cancer, and discuss the potential role of MRI for assessing response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Although MRI has improved sensitivity compared with conventional imaging, this has not translated into improved short-term surgical outcomes or long-term patient benefit, such as improved local control or survival, in any patient population. MRI is an important diagnostic test in the evaluation of patients presenting with occult primary breast cancer and has shown promise in monitoring response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy; however, the data do not support the routine use of perioperative MRI in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: The National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, a national coalition of public, private, and voluntary organizations, has recently announced an initiative to increase colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates in the United States to 80% by 2018. The authors evaluated the potential public health benefits of achieving this goal. METHODS: The authors simulated the 1980 through 2030 United States population of individuals aged 50 to 100 years using microsimulation modeling. Test-specific historical screening rates were based on National Health Interview Survey data for 1987 through 2013. The effects of increasing screening rates from approximately 58% in 2013 to 80% in 2018 were compared to a scenario in which the screening rate remained approximately constant. The outcomes were cancer incidence and mortality rates and numbers of CRC cases and deaths during short-term follow-up (2013-2020) and extended follow-up (2013-2030). RESULTS: Increasing CRC screening rates to 80% by 2018 would reduce CRC incidence rates by 17% and mortality rates by 19% during short-term follow-up and by 22% and 33%, respectively, during extended follow-up. These reductions would amount to a total of 277,000 averted new cancers and 203,000 averted CRC deaths from 2013 through 2030. CONCLUSIONS: Achieving the goal of increasing the uptake of CRC screening in the United States to 80% by 2018 may have a considerable public health impact by averting approximately 280,000 new cancer cases and 200,000 cancer deaths within <20 years.

BACKGROUND: Although there is a recognition of the importance of fertility to young women with cancer, we do not know who is at risk of distress related to fertility issues following diagnosis. We investigated the determinants of fertility-related distress adopting a cross-cultural perspective and using the Common Sense Model (CSM). We chose the CSM as a theoretical framework as it allows to explore how individuals conceptualise illness within the socio-cultural context. METHODS: British and Polish women with breast or gynaecological cancer were recruited through outpatient clinics or online outlets and completed a questionnaire. Linear regression, mediation and moderated mediation methods were performed. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-four women participated (mean age 34.55 (SD = 6.66); 78.7% had gynaecological cancer). The determinants of fertility-related distress were: country of origin, recruitment site, negative affect, desire to have children, treatment regret, and total illness perception score. The impact of the desire to have children on fertility-related distress was mediated by psychological value of children, perceived consequences of cancer on one's life, emotional representation, and treatment-related regret. Country of origin moderated the relationship between the desire to have children and fertility-related distress when mediated by treatment-related regret. CONCLUSIONS: The CSM proved useful in investigating predictors of fertility-related distress, with emotional, rather than cognitive representation of illness determining its levels. Socio-cultural background played a role in determining one's fertility-related distress and contributed to the explanation of the relationship between one's desire to have children, treatment-related regret, and fertility-related distress.

INTRODUCTION: For early stage breast cancer patients, non-breast cancer mortality including secondary cancers and cardiac events can overshadow the benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy. This study evaluates the excess risk of secondary cancer for various breast radiotherapy techniques including accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI). METHODS: Secondary cancers Lifetime Attributable Risks (LAR) were calculated using a modified BEIR-VII formalism to account for the specific survival of breast cancer patients. Those survivals were extracted from the SEER database. Doses scattered to various organs were measured into a Rando phantom with custom-made breast phantoms. Treatments delivered typical doses of brachytherapy APBI (34Gy in 10 fractions), external beam APBI (38.5Gy in 10 fractions) using 3D-conformal, Cyberknife stereotactic (CK), or VMAT, as well as whole breast irradiation (WBI) delivering 42.5Gy in 16 fractions. RESULTS: WBI resulted in the highest total LAR, with 4.3% excess risk of secondary cancer for a patient treated at age 50years. Lung cancers accounted for 75-97% of secondary malignancies. For a typical early stage patient irradiated at 50, the excess risks of secondary lung cancer were 1.1% for multicatheter HDR, between 2.2% and 2.5% for 3D-CRT or CK, 3.5% for VMAT APBI, and 3.8% for WBI. CONCLUSIONS: APBI reduces the risk of secondary cancer 2-4 fold compared to WBI. These techniques are well suited for long-living early stage breast cancer patients. HDR brachytherapy and 3D-conformal APBI achieve mean lung doses between 1 and 1.5Gy, which could serve as reference.

OBJECTIVE: Thiamine deficiency (TD) is increasingly recognized in medically ill patients. The prevalence of TD among cancer patients is unknown. This study aims to characterize the prevalence of TD among inpatients with cancer. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of patients admitted to a large cancer center who were referred for psychiatric consultation and whose serum thiamine concentration was measured. Patients with alcohol use were excluded. RESULTS: Among 217 patients with various cancer types, TD was found in 55.3%. Risk factors included fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, significant weight loss, and undergoing active cancer treatment. Almost all patients were normal weight, overweight, or obese, and few had concomitant vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. A total of 17.5% were receiving multivitamin supplementation. Nearly half (49.8%) did not receive empiric treatment with thiamine and among those who did, treatment delay occurred in the majority of cases (59.6%). Measurement of serum thiamine concentration preceded psychiatric consultation in only 10.6% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that TD is highly prevalent among inpatients with cancer, even among normal and overweight individuals, in the absence of other vitamin deficiencies, and while receiving multivitamin supplements. Several potential risk factors were identified, including active cancer treatment. Evaluation of TD was most commonly not initiated by oncologists. Failure to treat and treatment delay were common. Given these findings, oncologists must be vigilant about detecting TD among inpatients with cancer. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

BACKGROUND: Alcohol is a risk factor for cancer of the oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, colorectum, liver, larynx and female breast, whereas its impact on other cancers remains controversial. METHODS: We investigated the effect of alcohol on 23 cancer types through a meta-analytic approach. We used dose-response meta-regression models and investigated potential sources of heterogeneity. RESULTS: A total of 572 studies, including 486 538 cancer cases, were identified. Relative risks (RRs) for heavy drinkers compared with nondrinkers and occasional drinkers were 5.13 for oral and pharyngeal cancer, 4.95 for oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma, 1.44 for colorectal, 2.65 for laryngeal and 1.61 for breast cancer; for those neoplasms there was a clear dose-risk relationship. Heavy drinkers also had a significantly higher risk of cancer of the stomach (RR 1.21), liver (2.07), gallbladder (2.64), pancreas (1.19) and lung (1.15). There was indication of a positive association between alcohol consumption and risk of melanoma and prostate cancer. Alcohol consumption and risk of Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas were inversely associated. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol increases risk of cancer of oral cavity and pharynx, oesophagus, colorectum, liver, larynx and female breast. There is accumulating evidence that alcohol drinking is associated with some other cancers such as pancreas and prostate cancer and melanoma.

BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious complication of cancer and its treatment. The current study assessed the risk and clinical predictors of VTE in breast cancer patients by time since diagnosis. METHODS: This Swedish population-based study included 8338 breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2001 to 2008 in the Stockholm-Gotland region with complete follow-up until 2012. Their incidence of VTE was compared with the incidence among 39,013 age-matched reference individuals from the general population. Cox and flexible parametric models were used to examine associations with patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics, accounting for time-dependent effects. RESULTS: Over a median follow-up of 7.2 years, 426 breast cancer patients experienced a VTE event (cumulative incidence, 5.1%). The VTE incidence was 3-fold increased (hazard ratio [HR], 3.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.87-3.74) in comparison with the incidence in the general population and was highest 6 months after diagnosis (HR, 8.62; 95% CI, 6.56-11.33) with a sustained increase in risk thereafter (HR at 5 years, 2.19; 95% CI, 1.80-2.67). Independent predictors of VTE included the following: older age, being overweight, preexisting VTE, comorbid disease, tumor size > 40 mm, progesterone receptor (PR)-negative status, more than 4 affected lymph nodes, and receipt of chemo- and endocrine therapy. The impact of chemotherapy was limited to early-onset VTE, whereas comorbid disease and PR-negative status were more strongly associated with late-onset events. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the long-term risk of VTE in breast cancer patients and identifies a comprehensive set of clinical risk predictors. Temporal associations with patient, tumor, and treatment characteristics provide insight into the time-dependent etiology of VTE. Cancer 2017;123:468-475. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

At several recent, internationally attended scientific meetings, including the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR)'s "Shaping the Future of Cancer Prevention: A Roadmap for Integrative Cancer Science and Public Health" summit in Leesburg (VA) and the AACR Annual Meeting in New Orleans, the focus on cancer prevention to reduce cancer-related deaths was extensively discussed with renewed attention and emphasis. Cancer prevention should be actively proposed even to healthy individuals, and not just to individuals with high cancer risk. We discuss evaluation of a high cancer risk versus the relatively low risk for side effects of chemopreventive agents. The concept of cancer interception, which is halting transformed cells from becoming malignant cancers, should be adopted for cancer prevention. Potential prevention/interception actions include adopting healthy life style and avoiding carcinogens, repressing inflammation and pathologic angiogenesis, controlling metabolism, correcting insulin resistance and other metabolic alterations. Current drugs with limited toxicity can be repurposed to reduce cancer incidence. Aspirin is now being recommended for the prevention of colorectal cancer and it prevents other neoplasms as well. Metformin and beta-blockers could be valuable for reducing pancreatic and breast cancer onset. On the basis of the evaluation of cancer risk, we here call for personalized approaches for cancer prevention and preventive interception and we envisage a list of measures and potential guidelines for preventive and interceptive strategies to reduce cancer burden. Investment into translational research to bring these approaches into public health policies and in the clinic is urgently needed. Clin Cancer Res; 22(17); 4322-7. (c)2016 AACR.

It is speculated that genetic variants are associated with differential responses to nutrients (known as gene-diet interactions) and that these variations may be linked to different cancer risks. In this review, we critically evaluate the evidence across 314 meta-analyses of observational studies and randomized controlled trials of dietary risk factors and the five most common cancers (breast, lung, prostate, colorectal, and stomach). We also critically evaluate the evidence across 13 meta-analyses of observational studies of gene-diet interactions for the same cancers. Convincing evidence for association was found only for the intake of alcohol and whole grains in relation to colorectal cancer risk. Three nutrient associations had highly suggestive evidence and another 15 associations had suggestive evidence. Among the examined gene-diet interactions, only one had moderately strong evidence.

BACKGROUND: Women with advanced bladder cancer have inferior survival compared with men. However, women treated on clinical trials do not appear to have a survival disadvantage. Less frequent administration of systemic chemotherapy in women with advanced bladder cancer may contribute to their inferior survival. METHODS: The authors identified patients diagnosed with stage IV bladder cancer from 1998 through 2010 using the National Cancer Data Base, a national outcomes database that includes 70% of all newly diagnosed cancer cases in the United States. Sex differences in demographics, systemic chemotherapy administration, and overall survival (OS) were compared. RESULTS: A total of 23,981 patients were identified (35% of whom were female). Compared with men, women were older, more likely to be black, and less likely to be insured (P<.01 for all). The Charlson-Deyo comorbidity score did not differ between men and women. Women were less likely to receive systemic chemotherapy than men (45% vs 52%; adjusted relative risk, 0.91 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.88-0.94]). Women had a lower median OS compared with men (8.0 months [95% CI, 7.7-8.3 months] vs 9.8 months [95% CI, 9.5-10.0 months]; P<.001). OS remained lower for women on multivariable analysis, even after adjusting for the administration of systemic chemotherapy (hazard ratio for death, 1.11 [95% CI, 1.08-1.15]). CONCLUSIONS: Women are less likely than men to receive systemic chemotherapy for advanced bladder cancer and this difference may partially account for the poorer OS observed in women. However, OS remains lower in women independent of chemotherapy use, and may be related to unmeasured comorbidities, functional status, or tumor biology. Cancer 2016;122:2012-20.

BACKGROUND: There is a body of evidence indicating that aspirin may reduce the risk of cancer mortality. However, to the authors' knowledge, the optimal exposure timing and mechanism of action remain unclear. In the current study, the authors investigated associations between prediagnostic aspirin use and breast cancer-specific mortality in a US population. METHODS: Postmenopausal women diagnosed with stage I to III breast cancer (1993-2009) were identified (2925 women with a total of 18,073 person-years) from the National Cancer Institute's Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Prediagnostic aspirin use (1274 women) was identified from study questionnaires. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for associations between aspirin use and breast cancer-specific mortality. Effect modification by lymph node status was evaluated. RESULTS: Prediagnostic aspirin use was not found to be associated with lower breast cancer-specific mortality (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.68-1.31 [P = .74]). In analyses stratified by lymph node status, aspirin use was found to be associated with lower breast cancer-specific mortality among women with lymph node-negative tumors (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.93 [P = 0.02]), but not those with lymph node-positive tumors (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 0.92-2.16 [P = 0.11]). Tests for interaction were found to be statistically significant (P for interaction =.006). No association was noted between aspirin use and lymph node status. CONCLUSIONS: Prediagnostic aspirin use was not found to be associated with a reduction in breast cancer-specific mortality overall. However, effect modification by lymph node status was observed and mortality was found to be reduced by approximately one-half among aspirin users with lymph node-negative disease. This represents a clinically significant reduction in breast cancer mortality. These findings contribute to the understanding of aspirin's mechanism of action in breast cancer. However, further etiologic research to understand this association is warranted. Cancer 2016;122:2067-75. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

INTRODUCTION: Several studies have reported disparities in the care management and survival of older cancer patients. The aim of our study was to identify determinants of treatment administration in this population of cancer patients aged over 65 years taking into account competing risks of death. METHODS: The INCAPAC study is a population-based study. Four cancer registries and three prospective cohort studies on older subjects (age >/=65 years) from Gironde, a French department, were merged to identify older cancer patients. We used a non-parametric multi-state model including three states (cancer, treatment and all-cause death). This model allowed studying determinants of treatment administration (all treatments including curative, symptomatic and palliative treatments) and mortality considering that patients can move from cancer state to death state, either directly or through the treatment phase. Studied variables were demographic and socioeconomic-, cancer-, health-, and geriatric-related. RESULTS: A total of 450 patients were included in the analyses. They were mainly aged 85 and over, men and educated. Among included patients, 372 (83%) received cancer treatment. In the final multivariate model, dementia was associated with a lower likelihood of receiving cancer treatment (HR=0.68, 95% CI=0.47-0.99). In treated patients, age, sex, comorbidities, dependency and stage at diagnosis were associated to all-cause mortality, and in untreated patients, diagnosis of dementia and stage at diagnosis were associated to mortality. CONCLUSION: Further studies are necessary to understand the impact of geriatric impairments on treatment administration and to develop clinical practice guidelines.

While experimental evidence suggests potential carcinogenic effects of increased iron load, there is a lack of data on iron status and cancer risk from epidemiological studies. Here, we evaluated prediagnostic serum concentrations of ferritin, iron and transferrin as well as transferrin saturation (TSAT) in relation to cancer risk and mortality in a prospective study by multivariable Cox regression analyses. A case-cohort sample of the population-based EPIC-Heidelberg Study including a random subcohort (n = 2738) and incident cases of breast cancer (n = 627), prostate cancer (n = 554), lung cancer (n = 195), colorectal cancer (n = 256) and cancer death (n = 759) was used. Ferritin levels were inversely associated with breast cancer risk in the multivariable Cox regression model, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.67 [95% confidence interval: 0.49, 0.92] for women in the highest quartile compared to those in the lowest quartile. Neither ferritin nor the other markers of iron status were significantly associated with colorectal, prostate or lung cancer risk. An inverse association was observed between ferritin and total cancer mortality (HR: 0.70 [0.53, 0.92]). There were no significant overall associations between serum iron, transferrin or TSAT and cancer mortality. The present findings do not support the notion of increased iron load constituting a cancer risk factor in the general population. By contrast, our analyses revealed inverse associations between ferritin levels and breast cancer risk as well as cancer mortality.

BACKGROUND: Some highly penetrant familial cancer syndromes exhibit elevated leukaemia risk, and there is evidence for familial clustering of lung cancer and other common cancers. Lung cancer and leukaemia are strongly radiogenic, but there are few indications that high-energy beam irradiation is markedly more effective than lower-energy radiation. METHODS: We used a Cox model with familially structured random effects to assess 16 mortality end points in a group of 1850 mice in 47 families maintained in a circular-breeding scheme, exposed to accelerated Si or Fe ions (0.4 Gy) or (137)Cs gamma rays (3 Gy). RESULTS: There is periodicity in the effect of familial relatedness, which is most pronounced for pulmonary adenoma, Harderian-gland adenoma, Harderian-gland tumour, ectodermal tumour, pulmonary adenocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma (P=0.0001/0.0003/0.0017/0.0035/0.0257/0.0340, respectively) with families that are 3-4 generations apart most strongly correlated; myeloid leukaemia also exhibited a striking periodic correlation structure. The relative risks of high-energy Si or Fe ions are not significantly different and are less than for (137)Cs gamma-rays for most end points at the doses used. CONCLUSIONS: There is periodicity in the effect of familial relatedness for various cancer sites. The effects per unit dose of high-energy charged particle beams are no higher than ninefold those of lower-energy gamma radiation.

Purpose: Women at familial/genetic ovarian cancer risk often undergo screening despite unproven efficacy. Research suggests each woman has her own CA125 baseline; significant increases above this level may identify cancers earlier than standard 6- to 12-monthly CA125 > 35 U/mL.Experimental Design: Data from prospective Cancer Genetics Network and Gynecologic Oncology Group trials, which screened 3,692 women (13,080 woman-screening years) with a strong breast/ovarian cancer family history or BRCA1/2 mutations, were combined to assess a novel screening strategy. Specifically, serum CA125 q3 months, evaluated using a risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA), detected significant increases above each subject's baseline, which triggered transvaginal ultrasound. Specificity and positive predictive value (PPV) were compared with levels derived from general population screening (specificity 90%, PPV 10%), and stage-at-detection was compared with historical high-risk controls.Results: Specificity for ultrasound referral was 92% versus 90% (P = 0.0001), and PPV was 4.6% versus 10% (P > 0.10). Eighteen of 19 malignant ovarian neoplasms [prevalent = 4, incident = 6, risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) = 9] were detected via screening or RRSO. Among incident cases (which best reflect long-term screening performance), three of six invasive cancers were early-stage (I/II; 50% vs. 10% historical BRCA1 controls; P = 0.016). Six of nine RRSO-related cases were stage I. ROCA flagged three of six (50%) incident cases before CA125 exceeded 35 U/mL. Eight of nine patients with stages 0/I/II ovarian cancer were alive at last follow-up (median 6 years).Conclusions: For screened women at familial/genetic ovarian cancer risk, ROCA q3 months had better early-stage sensitivity at high specificity, and low yet possibly acceptable PPV compared with CA125 > 35 U/mL q6/q12 months, warranting further larger cohort evaluation.

BACKGROUND: microRNAs (miRNAs) are crucially important in the development of cancer. Their dysregulation, commonly observed in various types of cancer, is largely cancer-dependent. Thus, to understand the tumor biology and to develop accurate and sensitive biomarkers, we need to understand pan-cancer miRNA expression. CONSTRUCTIONS: At the University of Minnesota, we developed the OncomiR Cancer Database (OMCD), hosted on a web server, which allows easy and systematic comparative genomic analyses of miRNA sequencing data derived from more than 9500 cancer patients tissue samples available in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). OMCD includes associated clinical information and is searchable by organ-specific terms common to the TCGA. CONCLUSIONS: Freely available to all users ( www.oncomir.umn.edu/omcd/ ), OMCD enables (1) simple visualization of TCGA miRNA sequencing data, (2) statistical analysis of differentially expressed miRNAs for each cancer type, and (3) exploration of miRNA clusters across cancer types.

Although religion/spirituality (R/S) is important in its own right for many cancer patients, a large body of research has examined whether R/S is also associated with better physical health outcomes. This literature has been characterized by heterogeneity in sample composition, measures of R/S, and measures of physical health. In an effort to synthesize previous findings, a meta-analysis of the relation between R/S and patient-reported physical health in cancer patients was performed. A search of PubMed, PsycINFO, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and the Cochrane Library yielded 2073 abstracts, which were independently evaluated by pairs of raters. The meta-analysis was conducted for 497 effect sizes from 101 unique samples encompassing more than 32,000 adult cancer patients. R/S measures were categorized into affective, behavioral, cognitive, and 'other' dimensions. Physical health measures were categorized into physical well-being, functional well-being, and physical symptoms. Average estimated correlations (Fisher z scores) were calculated with generalized estimating equations with robust variance estimation. Overall R/S was associated with overall physical health (z = 0.153, P < .001); this relation was not moderated by sociodemographic or clinical variables. Affective R/S was associated with physical well-being (z = 0.167, P < .001), functional well-being (z = 0.343, P < .001), and physical symptoms (z = 0.282, P < .001). Cognitive R/S was associated with physical well-being (z = 0.079, P < .05) and functional well-being (z = 0.090, P < .01). 'Other' R/S was associated with functional well-being (z = 0.100, P < .05). In conclusion, the results of the current meta-analysis suggest that greater R/S is associated with better patient-reported physical health. These results underscore the importance of attending to patients' religious and spiritual needs as part of comprehensive cancer care.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors may continue to experience psychosocial and physical needs related to their cancer experience for many years after treatment. The specification of these needs across cancer types and by survivor characteristics may lead to better prevention approaches and clinical responses. Mixed methods were used to examine responses to an open-ended question about current unmet needs from a survey of 2-, 5-, and 10-year cancer survivors. METHODS: Qualitative techniques were used to code themes of unmet needs from open-ended responses. These themes were then examined with quantitative techniques to describe the frequency of unmet needs across disease subgroups and demographic subgroups of survivors. RESULTS: There were 1514 responses to the open-ended question on unmet needs. Respondents ranged in age from 24 to 97 years and included proportionately more women, and 18% were minorities (black and Hispanic). Sixteen themes of unmet needs were identified. The number and type of unmet needs were not associated with the time since cancer treatment. Breast cancer survivors identified more unmet needs than other survivors. Male survivors and especially prostate cancer survivors identified personal control problems as current needs. Older cancer survivors identified fewer unmet needs on average than younger survivors. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis of an open-ended question on unmet needs extends our understanding of how cancer survivors perceive problems related to cancer. How cancer-related needs change over time and differ by sex, race, and ethnicity and how problems with personal control become manifest are areas of inquiry requiring further research.

BACKGROUND: Serious psychological distress (SPD) is associated with adverse health outcomes such as poor quality of life and shorter survival in cancer survivors, but to the authors' knowledge, the relationship between SPD and health care use and medical expenditures is not clear. METHODS: A total of 4326 cancer survivors and 57,109 noncancer participants were identified from the 2008 through 2010 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, a nationwide population-based survey, and their psychological distress was assessed with the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (SPD defined by a score >/=13). The association between SPD and use and medical expenditures of various types of health care (office-based, outpatient, hospital inpatient, emergency department, dental, and prescriptions) was examined using a 2-part modeling approach that adjusted for demographic, personal, and comorbidity factors. The marginal effects of SPD on health care use and expenditures were calculated for cancer survivors and were compared with those of noncancer participants. RESULTS: The weighted prevalence of SPD in cancer survivors was 8.2% compared with 4.8% in the noncancer participants. SPD was significantly associated with higher use of all care types except dental care in cancer survivors. Cancer survivors with SPD spent $4431 (95% confidence interval, $3419-$5443) more than survivors without SPD on medical services each year, whereas this extra expenditure associated with SPD for participants without cancer was $2685 (95% confidence interval, $2099-$3271). CONCLUSIONS: In a national representative sample of cancer survivors, SPD was found to be associated with higher health care use and medical expenditures. Distress screening and psychosocial care in cancer survivors may help reduce the economic burden of cancer in the United States.

Laryngeal cancer accounts for approximately 2.4% of new malignancies worldwide each year. Early identification of laryngeal neoplasms results in improved prognosis and functional outcomes. Imaging plays an integral role in the diagnosis, staging, and long-term follow-up of laryngeal cancer. This article highlights advanced laryngeal imaging techniques and their application to early glottic neoplasms.

We conducted a retrospective study aiming to assess the risk, and associated risk factors, of developing subsequent skin cancers after having a first diagnosis of skin cancer. We included all patients with biopsy-proven skin cancer attending a dermatology clinic between July 2007 and July 2017. We assessed the frequency of new skin cancers, as well as potential demographic and clinical factors significantly associated with occurrence of such neoplasms, that were identified by means of a survival analysis. We analyzed 969 patients with a total of 1584 skin neoplasms (1122 basal cell carcinomas (BCC), 310 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC), 143 melanomas and 9 other neoplasms). 165 patients (17.0%) developed subsequent skin neoplasms. Factors identified in multivariable models to be significantly associated with development of new skin cancers included older age (adjusted HR = 1.04 per year; 95%CI = 1.02-1.05; p < 0.001), and presence of synchronous neoplasms (adjusted HR = 2.25; 95%CI = 1.61-3.14; p < 0.001). Having a history of a BCC was significantly associated with development of new BCC (adjusted HR = 1.63; 95%CI = 1.05-2.54; p = 0.030), while having a previous SCC was associated with occurrence of subsequent SCC (adjusted HR = 3.60; 95%CI = 1.93-6.72; p < 0.001). These findings point to the importance of careful follow-up (e.g., skin self-examination and full body examination) of skin cancer patients.

INTRODUCTION: The curing of a testicular tumour is currently feasible in more than 95% of patients, and in 80% of those with metastases. Until now, there has been no study or series of cases that describe the ocular changes of the posterior segment associated with testicular cancer. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patients with a diagnosis of testicular cancer in order to determine the presence of changes in the posterior segment and the relationship to the stage. MATERIAL AND METHOD: An observational, cross-sectional, and descriptive study was conducted on 21 male patients (42 eyes) with a diagnosis of testicular cancer. Age, histological type, time of evolution, stage, treatment, and comorbidities were recorded, as well as visual acuity measurement (LogMAR), biomicroscopy of the anterior segment, and photographic records of the posterior pole and peripheral retina. RESULTS: The mean age was 29 years (18-43 years). All (100%) of the patients were treated surgically. The most frequent histological type was classic seminoma (42.8%), followed by the mixed germinal tumour (38.0%). At the time of evaluation, 42.8% of patients had a stage II, and 23.8% had distant metastasis. The changes in the posterior segment were: vascular tortuosity (14.2%), retinopathy associated with cancer (9.5%), choroidal metastasis (9.5%), pigmentary changes of the retinal pigment epithelium (9.5%), and retinal metastasis (4.7%). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible to find changes at the level of retinal pigment epithelium, as well as vascular tortuosity, retinopathy associated with cancer, and choroidal and/or retina metastases.

Cancer initiation is presumed to occur in utero for many childhood cancers and it has been hypothesized that advanced paternal age may have an impact due to the increasing number of mutations in the sperm DNA with increasing paternal age. We examined the association between paternal age and specific types of childhood cancer in offspring in a large nationwide cohort of 1,904,363 children born in Denmark from 1978 through 2010. The children were identified in the Danish Medical Birth Registry and were linked to information from other national registers, including the Danish Cancer Registry. In total, 3,492 children were diagnosed with cancer before the age of 15 years. The adjusted hazard ratio of childhood cancer according to paternal age was estimated using Cox proportional hazards regressions. We found a 13% (95% confidence interval: 4-23%) higher hazard rate for every 5 years advantage in paternal age for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, while no clear association was found for acute myeloid leukemia (hazard ratio pr. 5 years = 1.02, 95% confidence interval: 0.80-1.30). The estimates for neoplasms in the central nervous system suggested a lower hazard rate with higher paternal age (hazard ratio pr. 5 years = 0.92, 95% confidence interval: 0.84-1.01). No clear associations were found for the remaining childhood cancer types. The findings suggest that paternal age is moderately associated with a higher rate of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but not acute myeloid leukemia, in offspring, while no firm conclusions could be made for other specific cancer types.

The number of patients with cancer being admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) is increasing worldwide, and these patients are vulnerable to infection. This study aimed to address the long-term impact of positive cultures during admission on 1-year mortality among patients with cancer who received perioperative intensive care. This retrospective cohort study enrolled adult patients with cancer who were admitted to ICUs and received surgery during 2011 to 2016 at a tertiary hospital in central Taiwan. Cancer-related data were retrieved from the cancer registry, and data during ICU admissions were obtained from the electronic medical records. We compared the survival curves between patients with and without positive clinical cultures using log-rank test and used a multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression model to evaluate the influence of positive clinical cultures on 1-year mortality. A total of 638 patients were included for analyses, and 37.9% of them had positive cultures during the index admission. In-hospital mortality was 9.1%, while 1-year mortality was 21.0%. Compared with patients who survived, patients who died were significantly more likely to have positive cultures (59.7% vs 32.1%), to have a higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores (median 21.8 vs 19.0), and to receive mechanical ventilation (86.6% vs 77.4%). Survival analysis found that positive cultures of blood, the respiratory tract, the urinary tract, or the skin and soft tissue were associated with an increased 1-year mortality. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis found that positive cultures of blood, the respiratory tract, the urinary tract, or the skin and soft tissue (hazard ratio: 1.621; 95% confidence interval: 1.087-2.419) were significantly associated with 62.1% increased hazards of death within 1 year after the ICU admission. A positive culture during admission was associated with a worsened long-term survival among patients with cancer who received perioperative intensive care. Further studies are needed to confirm this association.

PURPOSE: An epidemiologic study of childhood cancer would provide useful information on cancer etiology and development of management guidelines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data from the Korea National Cancer Incidence Database were used to examine the incidence and survival of cancer in patients aged 0-14 years. Patients were grouped according to the International Classification of Childhood Cancer, 3rd edition. Age-specific and age-standardized incidences per million and estimated annual percentage change (APC) were calculated by sex and age. Five-year relative survival was calculated for four periods from 1993 to 2011. RESULTS: The study comprised 15,113 patients with malignant neoplasms. Age-standardized incidence rates for all cancers were 134.9 per million children in 1999-2011 and 144.0 and 124.9 per million for males and females, respectively (M/F ratio, 1.2; p < 0.05). The highest incidences were observed for 'leukemias, myeloproliferative diseases, and myelodysplastic diseases' (group I) (46.4), 'central nervous system neoplasms' (group III) (18.3), and 'lymphomas and reticuloendothelial neoplasms' (group II) (13.4). Age-standardized incidence increased from 117.9 in 1999 to 155.3 in 2011, with an APC of 2.4% (95% confidence interval, 2.1 to 2.7). There was a significant increase of APC in 'neuroblastoma and other peripheral nervous cell tumors' (group IV) (5.6%) and 'other malignant epithelial neoplasms and malignant melanomas' (group XI) (5.6%). The 5-year relative survival rate for all childhood cancers improved significantly from 56.2% (1993-1995) to 78.2% (2007-2011) (males, 56.7% to 77.7%; females, 55.5% to 78.8%). CONCLUSION: This study provides reliable information on incidence and survival trends for childhood cancer in Korea.

BACKGROUND: We examined the association between metabolic dysregulation and cancer mortality in a prospective cohort of Black and White adults. METHODS: A total of 25,038 Black and White adults were included in the analysis. Metabolic dysregulation was defined in two ways: 1) using the joint harmonized criteria for metabolic syndrome (MetS) and 2) based on factor analysis of 15 variables characterizing metabolic dysregulation. We estimated hazards ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association of MetS and metabolic dysregulation with cancer mortality during follow-up using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: About 46% of Black and 39% of White participants met the criteria for MetS. Overall, participants with MetS (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 1.03-1.45) were at increased risk of cancer-related death. In race-stratified analysis, Black participants with MetS had significantly increased risk of cancer mortality compared with those without MetS (HR: 1.32, 95% CI: 1.01-1.72), increasing to more than a 2-fold risk of cancer mortality among those with five metabolic syndrome components (HR: 2.35, 95% CI: 1.01-5.51). CONCLUSIONS: There are marked racial differences in the prevalence of metabolic dysregulation defined as MetS based on the harmonized criteria. The strong positive associations between MetS and cancer mortality suggests that efforts to improve cancer outcomes in general, and racial disparities in cancer outcomes specifically, may benefit from prevention and management of MetS and its components.

BACKGROUND: As panel testing becomes more common in clinical practice, it is important to understand the prevalence and trends associated with the pathogenic variants (PVs) identified. This is especially true for genetically heterogeneous cancers, such as breast cancer (BC), in which PVs in different genes may be associated with various risks and cancer subtypes. The authors evaluated the outcomes of genetic testing among women who had a personal history of BC. METHODS: A total of 35,409 women with a single diagnosis of BC who underwent clinical genetic testing with a 25-gene panel were included in the current analysis. Women with multiple BCs and men with BC were excluded. The frequency and distribution of PVs were assessed for the overall cohort, among women with triple-negative BC (TNBC) (n = 4797), and by age at diagnosis. RESULTS: PVs were identified in 9.3% of women tested; 51.5% of PVs were identified in genes other than breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and BRCA2, including checkpoint kinase 2 (CHEK2) (11.7%), ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM; ATM serine/threonine kinase) (9.7%), and partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) (9.3%). The prevalence of PVs in BRCA1, PALB2, BRCA1-associated RING domain 1 (BARD1), BRCA1-interacting protein C-terminal helicase 1 (BRIP1), and RAD51 paralog C (RAD51C) was statistically higher among women with TNBC. The PV rate was higher among women aged <40 years, lower among women aged >59 years, and relatively constant (8.5%-9.0%) among women who were diagnosed between ages 40 and 59 years. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that panel testing increased the number of women identified as carrying a PV in this cohort compared with BRCA testing alone. Furthermore, the proportion of women identified who carried a PV in this cohort did not decrease between ages 40 and 59 years. Cancer 2017;123:1721-1730. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: Korean American women have among the lowest rates of cervical cancer screening in the United States. The authors evaluated a multicomponent intervention combining community education with navigation services to reduce access barriers and increase screening rates in this underserved population. It was hypothesized that cervical cancer screening rates would be higher among women who received the intervention program compared with those in the control program. METHODS: Korean American women (N = 705) were recruited from 22 churches. In this matched-pair, group-randomized design, 347 women received the intervention, which consisted of a culturally relevant cancer education program combined with provision of navigation services. The control group (N = 358) received general health education, including information about cervical cancer risk and screening and where to obtain low-cost or no-cost screening. Screening behavior was assessed 12 months after the program. RESULTS: Screening behavior data were obtained from 588 women 12 months after the program. In both site-level and participant-level analyses, the intervention program contributed to significantly higher screening rates compared with the control program (odds ratio [OR], 25.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.1-66.1; P < .001). In sensitivity analysis, the treatment effect remained highly significant (OR, 16.7; 95% CI, 8.1-34.4; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: A multicomponent intervention combining community cancer education with navigation services yielded significant increases in cervical cancer screening rates among underscreened Korean American women. Community-accessible programs that incorporate cancer education with the delivery of key navigation services can be highly effective in increasing cervical cancer screening rates in this underserved population.

This article evaluates how older cancer patients describe cancer survivorship and incorporate the cancer experience into long-term evaluations of health. From a series of 53 qualitative interviews with adults with histories of breast and prostate cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, we analyzed age-related discussions among those 65 and older (n = 21). Emergent themes revealed the: (1) historical conceptualization of cancer, (2) changed perspective following diagnosis, (3) cancer in the context of a long biography, (4) cancer in the context of the aging body and decline, and (5) meaning of time remaining and quality of life. One important suggestion from our work, relevant to all clinicians regardless of specialty or role, is to incorporate goals for the future into individualized survivor care plans for older survivors.

There has been limited success in identifying prognostic biomarkers in prostate cancer. A partial explanation may be that insufficient emphasis has been put on clearly defining what type of marker or patient category a biomarker study aims to identify and how different cohort characteristics affect the ability to identify such a marker. In this article, the authors put forth the ABC model of prostate cancer, which defines 3 groups of patients with localized disease that an investigator may seek to identify: patients who, within a given time frame, will not develop metastases even if untreated (category A), will not develop metastases because of radical treatment (category B), or will develop metastases despite radical treatment (category C). The authors demonstrate that follow-up time and prostate-specific antigen screening intensity influence the prevalence of patients in categories A, B, and C in a study cohort, and that prognostic markers must be tested in both treated and untreated cohorts to accurately distinguish the 3 groups. The authors suggest that more emphasis should be put on considering these factors when planning, conducting, and interpreting the results from prostate cancer biomarker studies, and propose the ABC model as a framework to aid in that process.

BACKGROUND: Thyroid cancer incidence in the United States, particularly in women, has increased dramatically since the 1980s. Although the causes of thyroid cancer in most patients remain largely unknown, evidence suggests the existence of an inherited predisposition to development of differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Therefore, the authors explored the association between sporadic DTC and family history of cancer. METHODS: In a retrospective hospital-based case-control study of prospectively recruited subjects who completed the study questionnaire upon enrollment, unconditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as estimates of the DTC risk associated with first-degree family history of cancer. RESULTS: The study included 288 patients with sporadic DTC and 591 cancer-free controls. Family history of thyroid cancer in first-degree relatives was associated with increased DTC risk (adjusted OR, 4.1; 95% CI, 1.7-9.9). All DTC cases in patients with a first-degree family history of thyroid cancer were cases of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (adjusted OR, 4.6; 95% CI, 1.9-11.1). Notably, the risk of PTC was highest in subjects with a family history of thyroid cancer in siblings (OR, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.8-30.4). In addition, multifocal primary tumor was more common among PTC patients with first-degree family history of thyroid cancer than among PTC patients with no first-degree family history of thyroid cancer (68.8% vs 35.5%, P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: The study suggests that family history of thyroid cancer in first-degree relatives, particularly in siblings, is associated with an increased risk of sporadic PTC.

The molecular pathways that contribute to the proliferation and drug response of cancer cells are highly complex and currently insufficiently characterized. We have identified a previously unknown microRNA-based mechanism that provides cancer cells means to stimulate tumorigenesis via increased genomic instability and, at the same time, evade the action of clinically utilized microtubule drugs. We demonstrate miR-493-3p to be a novel negative regulator of mitotic arrest deficient-2 (MAD2), an essential component of the spindle assembly checkpoint that monitors the fidelity of chromosome segregation. The microRNA targets the 3' UTR of Mad2 mRNA thereby preventing translation of the Mad2 protein. In cancer cells, overexpression of miR-493-3p induced a premature mitotic exit that led to increased frequency of aneuploidy and cellular senescence in the progeny cells. Importantly, excess of the miR-493-3p conferred resistance of cancer cells to microtubule drugs. In human neoplasms, miR-493-3p and Mad2 expression alterations correlated with advanced ovarian cancer forms and high miR-493-3p levels were associated with reduced survival of ovarian and breast cancer patients with aggressive tumors, especially in the paclitaxel therapy arm. Our results suggest that intratumoral profiling of miR-493-3p and Mad2 levels can have diagnostic value in predicting the efficacy of taxane chemotherapy.

BACKGROUND: The authors examine trends in spending on cancer from 1998 through 2012, including cancer care costs, prevalence, and cases by payer, and discuss the results within the context of a prior analysis and recent health policy and programmatic changes. METHODS: Condition-specific distribution of expenditures from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, supplemented with results from the National Nursing Home Survey and other data sources, was used as the basis for allocating the Personal Health Care components of the National Health Expenditure Accounts among conditions. RESULTS: Cancer care expenditures grew at an annualized rate of 2.9% from 1998 to 2012. The share of expenditures for hospital-based care declined to a low of 48% during 2007 through 2009. Professional and clinical services' shares declined substantially between 2007 to 2009 and 2010 to 2012 when the hospital share increased. Treated prevalence decreased for all payers between the first and last study periods with the exception of private payers (11.2% increase). Out-of-pocket expenditures declined to 4.7%, whereas Medicare's share increased slightly. Medication expenditures increased, notably within retail and mail order settings. CONCLUSIONS: The previous rapid growth of cancer prevalence and expenditures has now slowed, most remarkably since the 2007 recession. Out-of-pocket expenses for cancer treatment continue to decline, most recently reaching the lowest point in 25 years. In addition, the early effects of Affordable Care Act expansion can be observed in the decline of treated prevalence in the Medicaid population as the demographics of Medicaid enrollees change.

Accreditation standards are at the forefront of evolving healthcare systems, setting metrics for high-quality care. Healthcare outcomes (health, experience, cost, provider satisfaction/burn out) are becoming mutual goals of the patient, provider, payer, and healthcare system. Achieving high-quality outcomes in cancer care necessitates collaboration among interdisciplinary teams of clinical providers, administrators, patient advocates, caregivers, and researchers. Dissemination and implementation science provides necessary frameworks to organize the efforts of these implementation teams, inclusive of identifying facilitators and barriers to implementation of accreditation standards. Since 2015, cancer distress screening has been mandated for continued cancer center accreditation by the American College of Surgeon's Commission on Cancer. Cancer centers have thus become real world implementation laboratories. We present the current context of distress screening, highlighting prior research and key areas of future research. We consider multiple levels of cancer care delivery and the use of interdisciplinary teams to help cancer center teams adopt, implement, and maintain efficient distress screening programs. Finally, we present a case study to identify methods for successful implementation of distress screening at one cancer center and then describe efficiencies that can be introduced using elements from human factors engineering, e- and m-health screening platforms, and community partnerships.

The acquisition of cancer hallmarks requires molecular alterations at multiple levels including genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome. In the past decade, numerous attempts have been made to untangle the molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis involving single OMICS approaches such as scanning the genome for cancer-specific mutations and identifying altered epigenetic-landscapes within cancer cells or by exploring the differential expression of mRNA and protein through transcriptomics and proteomics techniques, respectively. While these single-level OMICS approaches have contributed towards the identification of cancer-specific mutations, epigenetic alterations, and molecular subtyping of tumors based on gene/protein-expression, they lack the resolving-power to establish the casual relationship between molecular signatures and the phenotypic manifestation of cancer hallmarks. In contrast, the multi-OMICS approaches involving the interrogation of the cancer cells/tissues in multiple dimensions have the potential to uncover the intricate molecular mechanism underlying different phenotypic manifestations of cancer hallmarks such as metastasis and angiogenesis. Moreover, multi-OMICS approaches can be used to dissect the cellular response to chemo- or immunotherapy as well as discover molecular candidates with diagnostic/prognostic value. In this review, we focused on the applications of different multi-OMICS approaches in the field of cancer research and discussed how these approaches are shaping the field of personalized oncomedicine. We have highlighted pioneering studies from "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)" consortium encompassing integrated OMICS analysis of over 11,000 tumors from 33 most prevalent forms of cancer. Accumulation of huge cancer-specific multi-OMICS data in repositories like TCGA provides a unique opportunity for the systems biology approach to tackle the complexity of cancer cells through the unification of experimental data and computational/mathematical models. In future, systems biology based approach is likely to predict the phenotypic changes of cancer cells upon chemo-/immunotherapy treatment. This review is sought to encourage investigators to bring these different approaches together for interrogating cancer at molecular, cellular, and systems levels.

Posttranslational modifications of tumor suppressors can induce abnormal cell growth. Here, we identify site-specific O-GlcNAcylation as a critical block of FOXO3 that may abrogate a part of the p53 pathway, resulting in aberrant cancer cell growth. Of seven O-GlcNAcylation sites identified within the FOXO3 transactivation domain, we found that changes in O-GlcNAcylation at Ser284 modulated p21-mediated cancer cell growth. Overexpression of either O-GlcNAcylated FOXO3 (FOX-OV) or a Ser-to-Ala mutant (S284A) in PANC-1 cells indicated that S284 O-GlcNAc acts as a critical block of the FOXO tumor suppressor and induces proliferation in PANC-1 cancer cells by stimulating the MDM2-p53-p21 axis. Furthermore, S284A mutant cells lacking S284 O-GlcNAc and FOX-OV cells exhibited opposing MDM2-p53-p21 axis expression patterns at both the mRNA and protein levels. Thus, our study provides evidence to support a role for S284 O-GlcNAc as a critical block of FOXO3 to induce subsequent cancer cell growth via abrogation of the p53 regulatory circuit.Significance: These findings highlight a posttranslational mechanism for indirect abrogation of the p53 pathway, one that may occur with some frequency in human cancer cells.

AIM: To study factors associated with esophageal and non-esophageal cancer morbidity among Barrett's esophagus (BE) patients. METHODS: A cohort study within a single tertiary center included 386 consecutive patients with biopsy proven BE, who were recruited between 2004-2014. Endoscopic and histologic data were prospectively recorded. Cancer morbidity was obtained from the national cancer registry. Main outcomes were BE related (defined as esophagus and cardia) and non-BE related cancers (all other cancers). Cancer incidence and all-cause mortality were compared between patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) and with low-grade or no dysplasia (non-HGD) using Kaplan-Meier curves and cox regression models. RESULTS: Of the 386 patients, 12 had HGD, 7 had a BE related cancer. There were 75 (19.4%) patients with 86 cases of lifetime cancers, 76 of these cases were non-BE cancers. Seven (1.8%) and 18 (4.7%) patients had BE and non-BE incident cancers, respectively. Twelve (3.1%) patients had HGD as worst histologic result. Two (16.7%) and 16 (4.4%) incident non-BE cancers occurred in the HGD and non-HGD group, respectively. Ten-year any cancer and non-BE cancer free survival was 63% and 82% in the HGD group compared to 93% and 95% at the non-HGD group, respectively. Log-rank test for patients with more than one endoscopy, assuring longer follow up, showed a significant difference (P < 0.001 and P = 0.017 respectively). All-cause mortality was not significantly associated with BE HGD. CONCLUSION: Patients with BE and HGD, may have a higher risk for all-cause cancer morbidity. The implications on cancer prevention recommendations should be further studied.

Cancer is one of the major causes of death globally. The current treatment options are insufficient, leading to unmet medical needs in cancer treatment. Off-target side effects, multidrug resistance, selective distribution to cancerous tissues, and cell membrane permeation of anti-cancer agents are critical problems to overcome. There is a method to solve these problems by using receptor-mediated endocytosis (RME). It is well known that proteins such as integrin, HER2, EGFR, or other cancer biomarkers are specifically overexpressed on the surface of target cancer cells. By taking advantage of such specific receptors, payloads can be transported into cells through endocytosis using a conjugate composed of the corresponding ligands connected to the payloads by an appropriate linker. After RME, the payloads released by endosomal escape into the cytoplasm can exhibit the cytotoxic activity against cancer cells. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), tumor-homing peptides (THPs), and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are utilized as ligands in this system. Antibody drug conjugates (ADCs) based on RME have already been used to cure cancer. In addition to the canonical conjugate method, nanocarriers for spontaneous accumulation in cancer tissue due to enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect are extensively used. In this review, I introduce the possibilities and advantages of drug design and development based on RME for the treatment of cancer.

Background: Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are tumor-promoting and correlate with poor survival in many cancers, which has led to their emergence as potential therapeutic targets. However, effective methods to manipulate these cells clinically have yet to be developed. Methods: CAF accumulation and prognostic significance in head and neck cancer (oral, n = 260; oropharyngeal, n = 271), and colorectal cancer (n = 56) was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. Mechanisms regulating fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation were investigated in vitro using RNA interference/pharmacological inhibitors followed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunoblotting, immunofluorescence, and functional assays. RNA sequencing/bioinformatics and immunohistochemistry were used to analyze NAD(P)H Oxidase-4 (NOX4) expression in different human tumors. NOX4's role in CAF-mediated tumor progression was assessed in vitro, using CAFs from multiple tissues in Transwell and organotypic culture assays, and in vivo, using xenograft (n = 9-15 per group) and isograft (n = 6 per group) tumor models. All statistical tests were two-sided. Results: Patients with moderate/high levels of myofibroblastic-CAF had a statistically significant decrease in cancer-specific survival rates in each cancer type analyzed (hazard ratios [HRs] = 1.69-7.25, 95% confidence intervals [CIs] = 1.11 to 31.30, log-rank P </= .01). Fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transdifferentiation was dependent on a delayed phase of intracellular reactive oxygen species, generated by NOX4, across different anatomical sites and differentiation stimuli. A statistically significant upregulation of NOX4 expression was found in multiple human cancers (P < .001), strongly correlating with myofibroblastic-CAFs (r = 0.65-0.91, adjusted P < .001). Genetic/pharmacological inhibition of NOX4 was found to revert the myofibroblastic-CAF phenotype ex vivo (54.3% decrease in alpha-smooth muscle actin [alpha-SMA], 95% CI = 10.6% to 80.9%, P = .009), prevent myofibroblastic-CAF accumulation in vivo (53.2%-79.0% decrease in alpha-SMA across different models, P </= .02) and slow tumor growth (30.6%-64.0% decrease across different models, P </= .04). Conclusions: These data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of NOX4 may have broad applicability for stromal targeting across cancer types.

BACKGROUND: Although major cancer surgery at a high-volume hospital is associated with lower postoperative mortality, the use of such hospitals may not be equally distributed. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study socioeconomic and racial differences in cancer surgery at Commission on Cancer (CoC)-accredited high-volume hospitals. METHODS: The National Cancer Database (NCDB) was used to identify patients undergoing surgery for colon, esophageal, liver, and pancreatic cancer from 2003 to 2012. Annual hospital volume for each cancer was categorized using quartiles of patient volume. Patient-level predictors of surgery at a high-volume hospital, trends in the use of a high-volume hospital, and adjusted likelihood of surgery at a high-volume hospital in 2012 versus 2003 were analyzed. RESULTS: African American patients were less likely to undergo surgery at a high-volume hospital for esophageal (odds ratio [OR] 0.59, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.49-0.73) and pancreatic cancer (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.92), while uninsured patients and those residing in low educational attainment zip codes were less likely to undergo surgery at a high-volume hospital for esophageal, liver, and pancreatic cancer. In 2012, African Americans, uninsured patients, and those from low educational attainment zip codes were no more likely to undergo surgery at a high-volume hospital than in 2003 for any cancer type. These differences were not seen in colon cancer patients, for whom significant regionalization was not seen. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the use of CoC-accredited high-volume hospitals for major cancer surgery were seen nationwide and persisted over the duration of the study. Strategies to increase referrals and/or access to high-volume hospitals for African American and socioeconomically disadvantaged patients should be explored.

Resistance to therapy is one of the prime causes for treatment failure in cancer and recurrent disease. In recent years, autophagy has emerged as an important cell survival mechanism in response to different stress conditions that are associated with cancer treatment and aging. Autophagy is an evolutionary conserved catabolic process through which damaged cellular contents are degraded after uptake into autophagosomes that subsequently fuse with lysosomes for cargo degradation, thereby alleviating stress. In addition, autophagy serves to maintain cellular homeostasis by enriching nutrient pools. Although autophagy can act as a double-edged sword at the interface of cell survival and cell death, increasing evidence suggest that in the context of cancer therapy-induced stress responses, it predominantly functions as a cell survival mechanism. Here, we provide an up-to-date overview on our current knowledge of the role of pro-survival autophagy in cancer therapy at the preclinical and clinical stages and delineate the molecular mechanisms of autophagy regulation in response to therapy-related stress conditions. A better understanding of the interplay of cancer therapy and autophagy may allow to unveil new targets and avenues for an improved treatment of therapy-resistant tumors in the foreseeable future.

Despite the novel diagnostic methods and therapies implemented in oncology, the number of patients that succumb by the cancer remains high globally. Currently studies point out that 20-25% of all human malignancies are related to micro-organism infections. Among these cancer-related pathogens, the human papillomavirus (HPV) has a prominent position, since the virus is responsible for about 30% of all infectious agent-related cancers. Thus, an amount of cancers could be avoided by means prophylactic and/or therapeutic measures. However, these measures required a holistic comprehension about HPV-related cancer biology. Based on this, this review aims to summarize the last evidences of HPV on cancer biology (from initiation to metastasis), focus on molecular and biochemical deregulations associated with viral infection, and discuss the viral etiology in different malignancies.

BACKGROUND: Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) and the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway play crucial roles in the homeostasis of pancreatic cancer cells. This study combined for the first time the HSP90 inhibitor ganetespib (Gan) and the proteasome inhibitor carfilzomib (Carf) to target key mechanisms of homeostasis in pancreatic cancer. It was hypothesized that Gan plus Carf would elicit potent antitumor activity by modulating complementary homeostatic processes. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo effects of this combination on mechanisms of cell growth and viability were evaluated with human pancreatic cancer cell lines (MIA PaCa-2 and HPAC). RESULTS: Combined treatment with Gan and Carf significantly decreased cell viability. The mechanism varied by cell line and involved G2 -M cell-cycle arrest accompanied by a consistent reduction in key cell-cycle regulatory proteins and concomitant upregulation of p27. Further studies revealed increased autophagy markers, including the upregulation of autophagy related 7 and light chain 3 cleavage, and evidence of apoptosis (increased Bax expression and processing of caspase 3). Immunoblot analyses confirmed the modulation of other pathways that influence cell viability, including phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and nuclear factor kappaB. Finally, the treatment of athymic mice bearing HPAC tumors with Gan and Carf significantly reduced tumor growth in vivo. An immunoblot analysis of freshly isolated tumors from animals at the end of the study confirmed in vivo modulation of key signaling pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The results reveal Gan plus Carf to be a promising combination with synergistic antiproliferative, apoptotic, and pro-autophagy effects in preclinical studies of pancreatic cancer and will further the exploration of the utility of this treatment combination in clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Setting realistic targets for performance is a consistent challenge in quality improvement. In the current study, the authors used administrative data to define achievable targets for a panel of 15 previously developed quality indicators (QIs) focusing on systemic therapy in patients with early-stage breast cancer. METHODS: Deterministically linked administrative databases were used to identify patients with TNM stage I to stage III breast cancer who were diagnosed between 2006 and 2010 in Ontario, Canada. For each individual indicator, data-driven empirical benchmarks were calculated using the pared-mean benchmark approach. Variation in institution-level performance for each indicator was examined through the construction of funnel plots. RESULTS: A total of 28,303 patients with early-stage breast cancer were identified, 43% of whom received adjuvant chemotherapy. For the 9 QIs for which receiving the service or outcome was desirable (ie, consultation with a medical oncologist), the benchmark varied from 40.9% to 100%. For the 6 indicators for which not receiving the service or outcome was desirable (ie, incidence of febrile neutropenia), the benchmark varied from 0% to 49.0%. There was substantial variation noted with regard to the number of institutions meeting the target and the amount of interinstitution variation between the QIs. Top performing institutions varied by indicator, with no individual institution meeting the benchmark for all indicators. For the majority of indicators, institution size was not found to be correlated with performance. CONCLUSIONS: Data-derived benchmarking can be used to facilitate quality improvement by identifying areas of both good as well as suboptimal performance while defining an achievable target for which to strive.

BACKGROUND: Colorectal cancer (CRC) develops through the alteration of several critical pathways. This study was aimed at evaluating the influence of critical pathways on survival outcomes for patients with CRC. METHODS: Targeted next-generation sequencing of 40 genes included in the 5 critical pathways of CRC (WNT, P53, RTK-RAS, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase [PI3K], and transforming growth factor beta [TGF-beta]) was performed for 516 patients with stage III or high-risk stage II CRC treated with surgery followed by adjuvant fluoropyrimidine and oxaliplatin chemotherapy. The associations between critical pathway mutations and relapse-free survival (RFS) and overall survival were analyzed. The associations were further analyzed according to the tumor location. RESULTS: The mutation rates for the WNT, P53, RTK-RAS, PI3K, and TGF-beta pathways were 84.5%, 69.0%, 60.7%, 30.0%, and 28.9%, respectively. A mutation in the PI3K pathway was associated with longer RFS (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.36-0.99), whereas a mutation in the RTK-RAS pathway was associated with shorter RFS (adjusted HR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.01-2.52). Proximal tumors showed a higher mutation rate than distal tumors, and the mutation profile was different according to the tumor location. The mutation rates of Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA), and B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) were higher in proximal tumors, and the mutation rates of adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), tumor protein 53 (TP53), and neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) were higher in distal tumors. The better RFS with the PI3K pathway mutation was significant only for proximal tumors, and the worse RFS with the RTK-RAS pathway mutation was significant only for distal tumors. CONCLUSIONS: A PI3K pathway mutation was associated with better RFS for CRC patients treated with adjuvant chemotherapy, and an RTK-RAS pathway mutation was associated with worse RFS. The significance of the prognostic impact differed according to the tumor location. Cancer 2017;123:3513-23. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

Several large prospective studies show an association between serum uric acid (SUA) and cancer, however there is a lack of evidence in China. We aimed to investigate the effects of SUA levels on cancer incidence and mortality in China. This study included 20,577 adult hypertensive patients with valid SUA measurements who participated in the China Stroke Primary Prevention Trial where subjects were randomly assigned to receive a double-blind treatment of either 10 mg enalapril (n = 10,286) or 10.8 mg enalapril-folic acid (n = 10,291). Subjects were prospectively followed for a median of 4.5 years. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazards ratios (HR) of cancer risk associated with SUA. A total of 232 participants developed cancer. SUA was independently associated with increased cancer risk in the enalapril group [HR: 1.12, (95% CI: 1.03-1.22)]. Compared to the lowest tertile, combined subjects with SUA levels from the upper two tertiles had a higher risk of cancer in the enalapril group [T2 + T3: HR: 1.58, (95% CI: 1.02-2.47)]. In cancer site-specific analyses, a positive association of SUA levels with digestive cancer and all fatal cancer was also observed [HR: 1.18, (95% CI: 1.09-1.27); HR: 1.15, (95% CI: 1.03-1.28), respectively] in the enalapril group. Interestingly, SUA levels were not associated with the risk of cancer or related mortality in the enalapril folic acid group. Our results suggest that elevated SUA is independently and positively associated with the risk of total cancer incidence, digestive cancer incidence and cancer mortality among hypertensive Chinese.

PURPOSE: To investigate whether radiotherapy for prostate cancer increases the risk of therapy-related rectal cancer and colon cancer. METHODS: A systematic literature search was carried out using the Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library to identify studies examining the association between radiotherapy for prostate cancer and secondary colorectal cancer (rectal cancer and colon cancer) published before March 19, 2018. The risk of second colorectal cancer after radiotherapy was summarized using unadjusted odds ratio (OR) and adjusted hazard ratio (HR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to detect potential bias and heterogeneity. RESULTS: After study selection, 16 reports were retrieved for analysis. When patients received radiotherapy compared with those unexposed to radiation, there was an increased risk of the rectal cancer (OR 1.37, 95%CI 1.01 to 1.85), but not colon cancer. According to adjusted HR, there was an increased risk of the rectal cancer (HR 1.64, 95%CI 1.39 to 1.94), and colon cancer (HR 1.33, 95%CI 1.02 to 1.76). The OR for rectal cancer showed an increased risk with longer latent period (5 years lag time versus 10 years lag time, OR: 1.56 versus 2.22). Brachytherapy had no association with second cancer across all analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Radiotherapy was associated with an increased risk of subsequent rectal cancer compared with patients unexposed to radiation. Colon may be free from the damage of radiation. Brachytherapy had no association with second rectal cancer or colon cancer.

BACKGROUND: Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the Caribbean, including the islands of Trinidad and Tobago (TT). The population of TT consists of over 1.3 million people with diverse ancestral and sociocultural backgrounds, both of which may influence cancer incidence and mortality. The objective of this study was to examine incidence and mortality patterns and trends in TT. METHODS: Cancer surveillance data on 29,512 incident cancer cases reported to the Dr. Elizabeth Quamina Cancer Registry (population-based cancer registry of TT) between 1995 and 2009 were analyzed. Age-standardized rates, overall and by sex, ancestry, and geography, were reported. RESULTS: The highest incidence and mortality rates were observed for cancers related to reproductive organs in women, namely, breast, cervical, and uterine cancers, and prostate, lung and colorectal cancers among men. Average incidence rates were highest in areas covered by the Tobago Regional Health Authority (TRHA) (188 per 100,000), while average mortality rates were highest in areas covered by the North West Regional Health Authority (108 per 100,000). Nationals of African ancestry exhibited the highest rates of cancer incidence (243 per 100,000) and mortality (156 per 100,000) compared to their counterparts who were of East Indian (incidence, 125 per 100,000; mortality, 66 per 100,000) or mixed ancestry (incidence, 119 per 100,000; mortality, 66 per 100,000). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight the need for national investment to improve the understanding of the epidemiology of cancer in Trinidad and Tobago, and to ultimately guide much needed cancer prevention and control initiatives in the near future.

The aim of this study was to identify and compare cancer sites whose incidence is influenced by social deprivation. The study population comprised 189 144 cases of cancer diagnosed between 2006 and 2009, recorded in member registries of the French Network of Cancer Registries. Social environment was assessed at an aggregate level using the European Deprivation Index. The association between incidence and socioeconomic status was assessed by a geographical Bayesian Poisson model enabling a reduction of the overall variability and smoothing of the relative risks by sharing information provided by multiple geographic units. For cancers of the stomach, liver, lips-mouth-pharynx, and lung, a higher incidence in deprived populations was found for both sexes as well as for cancers of the larynx, esophagus, pancreas, and bladder in men and cervical cancer in women. For melanoma, prostate, testis, ovarian, and breast cancer, a higher incidence was observed in affluent populations. The highest relative risks of the lowest social class compared with the highest social class were found for larynx [relative risk (RR)=1.67 (1.43-1.95)], lips-mouth-pharynx [RR=1.89 (1.72-2.07)], and lung cancer [RR=1.59 (1.50-1.68)] in men and for cervix [RR=1.62 (1.40-1.88)] and lips-mouth-pharynx [RR=1.56 (1.30-1.86)] cancer in women. By estimating the burden of social deprivation on cancer incidence throughout France, this study enables us to measure the gains that could be achieved by implementing targeted prevention efforts.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between cancer and life expectancy is well established in both developed and developing countries. China is a vast country with significant geographical differences in population structure and healthcare, and thus provides a unique opportunity to analyze the complex relationship between life expectancy and cancer incidence and mortality rates. METHODS: Cancer data were extracted for a total of 255 units (cities or counties) from the 2013 National Central Cancer Registry. Life expectancy data at the unit level were obtained from the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Linear regression analysis was used to analyze the relationship between life expectancy and crude incidence and mortality rates of cancer. In a separate analysis, life expectancy was rated as low (< 76.0 years), middle (76-80 years), or high (> 80 years). RESULTS: Overall, the cancer incidence and mortality rates positively correlated with life expectancy in both sexes (R at 0.37 and 0.50, P < 0.001). The correlation was significant for the following cancers: lung, colorectal, prostate, bladder and pancreas, as well as for lymphoma in men (R 0.36-0.58, P < 0.001), lung, breast, colorectal, thyroid, uterus, and ovary in women (R 0.18-0.51, P < 0.001). We failed to observe an association between upper gastrointestinal cancer and life expectancy. The number of cities/counties with low, middle and high life expectancy levels were 110, 101 and 44, respectively. The highest age-standardized cancer incidence rate was observed in areas with a high life expectancy level (192.83/100,000). The highest age-standardized mortality rate was in areas with the lowest life expectancy (118.44/100,000). Cancers of the stomach, liver and esophagus are major cancer types in areas with low and middle life expectancy. In contrast, areas with high life expectancy had high incidence and mortality rates of colorectal cancer, breast cancer in women and prostate cancer in men. CONCLUSIONS: Longer life expectancy is associated with higher overall cancer incidence and mortality in China. The cancer pattern also varies substantially across areas with different life expectancy levels. Life expectancy levels must be considered when developing strategies to prevent and treat cancers.

BACKGROUND: To the authors' knowledge, it remains unknown whether race-based differences in cancer outcomes have changed with time. In the current study, the authors assessed whether racial disparities in cancer-specific mortality have improved over the last 20 years. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program was used to identify 2,713,474 patients diagnosed between 1988 and 2007 with either lung, breast, prostate, or colorectal cancer (the leading 3 causes of cancer-related mortality among each sex). After exclusions, 1,001,978 patients remained eligible for analysis. The impact of race on cancer-specific mortality was assessed using the regression model of Fine and Gray; an interaction model evaluated trends over time. RESULTS: African Americans presented with a more advanced stage of disease (P < .001) and underwent definitive therapy less often (P < .001) than whites. After adjustment for demographics and year of diagnosis, African Americans were found to have higher estimates of cancer-specific mortality than whites for all cancers combined (hazards ratio, 1.28; 95% confidence interval, 1.26-1.30 [P < .001]) and within each individual cancer (each P < .05). These differences did not change significantly between 1988 through 1997 and 1998 through 2007, except among patients with breast cancer, in whom survival disparities increased. These findings remained significant after adjustment for stage of disease at presentation and receipt of definitive therapy (hazards ratio for breast cancer mortality in African Americans vs whites: 1.37 from 1988-1997 and 1.53 from 1998-2007; P for interaction, < .001). CONCLUSIONS: The survival gap for African Americans has not closed over time. Race-based differences in outcome persist independent of stage of disease and treatment, suggesting that additional strategies beyond screening and improving access to care, such as further research into tumor biologies disproportionately affecting African Americans, are needed to improve survival for African American patients with cancer.

Survivors of pediatric and young adult cancers remain at risk for subsequent diseases, including those related to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Prevention of HPV acquisition through vaccination has become possible over the last decade. HPV vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective, yet rates of vaccination among childhood cancer survivors have remained low. Multiple factors, including stronger advocacy for this intervention from providers, could potentially increase vaccination and lead to lower HPV disease burdens for childhood cancer survivors. Health care providers for survivors of pediatric and adolescent cancers should prioritize counseling for HPV vaccination at follow-up visits. Cancer 2015;121:3435-43.

RATIONALE: Situs invsersus totalis (SIT) is a rare anomaly featured by complete inversion of abdominal and thoracic organs. Adrenal metastasis is often encountered as part of advanced systemic dissemination, which is usually unresectable. Few published cases reported the adrenal metastasis from gastric cancer with SIT and the treatment of gastrectomy combined with adrenalectomy, especially with intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT). PATIENT CONCERNS: A 61-year-old SIT man found a mass on the right clavicle and the biopsy revealed a metastatic cancer. Around 14 years ago, he had a rectal cancer resection surgery and no sign of occurrence. Five months later, the patient had a pain in his right low abdomen and abdominal CT found a right adrenal mass. DIAGNOSES: Gastroscopy and the pathology revealed the gastric antrum cancer invading the duodenal bulb. Abdominal enhanced CT suspected the adrenal mass as a hematoma, but positron emission tomography computed tomography suspected it as the metastases of gastric cancer which is consistent with the pathology results. Finally, the SIT patient was diagnosed with primary gastric cancer invading duodenal bulb with solitary right adrenal metastasis. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was treated with curative distal gastrectomy and Billroth-II anastomosis with D2 lymphadenectomy. A total 18 Gy intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) using low energy x-rays by Intrabeam were given after resection. OUTCOMES: The patient had liver metastasis in the seventh month after surgery but there is no sign of local recurrence until now. LESSONS: Gastric cancer with adrenal metastasis, especially with SIT is rare and intractable. The result suggested that active surgical treatment for resectable gastric cancer and solitary adrenal metastatic tumor, especially in combination with IORT may be an option in controlling local relapse and prolonging survival in selected patients.

PURPOSE: Despite the prevalence of fear of cancer recurrence (FCR), understanding of factors underlying clinically significant FCR is limited. This study examined factors associated with greater FCR morbidity, according to a cognitive processing model, in cancer survivors who screened positively for clinically significant FCR seeking psychological treatment through the ConquerFear trial. METHODS: Participants had completed treatment for breast, colorectal or melanoma cancer 2 months to 5 years previously and scored >/= 13/36 on the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form (FCRI-SF). Hierarchical regression analyses examined associations between demographic, medical and psychological variables, namely metacognitions (MCQ-30), post-traumatic stress symptoms (IES-R) and FCR (FCRI total score). RESULTS: Two hundred and ten (95%) of the 222 cancer survivors who consented to the ConquerFear trial completed the baseline questionnaire. Participants were predominantly (89%) breast cancer survivors. The final regression model accounted for 68% of the variance in FCR (demographic and medical variables 13%, metacognitions 26%, post-traumatic stress symptoms 28%). Negative metacognitive beliefs about worry and intrusive post-traumatic stress symptoms were significant individual correlates of FCR, but negative beliefs about worry did not significantly moderate the impact of intrusions on FCR morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide partial support for the cognitive processing model of FCR. Psychological factors were found to play an important role in FCR morbidity after controlling for demographic/medical factors. More intrusive thoughts and negative beliefs about worry were strong independent predictors of FCR morbidity. Cancer survivors with clinically significant FCR may benefit from assessment for intrusive thoughts and metacognitions and delivery of trauma- and/or metacognitive-based interventions accordingly.

BACKGROUND: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has reduced AIDS-defining cancer (ADC) mortality, but its effect on non-AIDS-defining cancer (NADC) mortality is unclear. To help inform cancer prevention and screening, we evaluated trends in NADC mortality among people with AIDS (PWA) in the ART era. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study analyzed AIDS surveillance data, including causes of death from death certificates, for PWA in San Francisco who died in 1996-2013. Proportional mortality ratios (PMRs), and year, age, race, sex-adjusted standardized mortality ratios (SMRs) were calculated for 1996-1999, 2000-2005, and 2006-2013, corresponding to advances in ART. RESULTS: The study included 5822 deceased PWA of whom 90% were male and 68% were aged 35-54 at time of death. Over time, the PMRs significantly decreased for ADCs (2.6%, 1.4%, 1.2%) and increased for NADCs (4.3%, 7.0%, 12.3%). For all years combined (1996-2013) and compared to the California population, significantly elevated SMRs were observed for these cancers: all NADCs combined (2.1), anal (58.4), Hodgkin lymphoma (10.5), liver (5.2), lung/larynx (3.0), rectal (5.2), and tongue (4.7). Over time, the SMRs for liver cancer (SMR 19.8, 11.2, 5.0) significantly decreased while the SMRs remained significantly elevated over population levels for anal (SMR 123, 48.2, 45.5), liver (SMR 19.8, 11.2, 5.0), and lung/larynx cancer (SMR 5.3, 4.7, 3.6). CONCLUSION: A decline in ADC PMRs and increase in NADC PMRs represent a shift in the cancer burden, likely due to ART use. Moreover, given their elevated SMRs, anal, liver, and lung/larynx cancer remain targets for improved cancer prevention, screening, and treatment.

PURPOSE: Pancreatic cancer associated double primary tumors are rare and their clinicopathologic characteristics are not well elucidated. Materials and Methods: Clinicopathologic factors of 1,352 primary pancreatic cancers with or without associated double primary tumors were evaluated. RESULTS: Of resected primary pancreatic cancers, 113 (8.4%) had associated double primary tumors, including 26 stomach, 25 colorectal, 18 lung, and 13 thyroid cancers. The median interval between the diagnoses of pancreatic cancer and associated double primary tumors was 0.5 months. Overall survival (OS) of pancreatic cancer patients with associated double primary tumors was longer than those with pancreatic cancer only (median, 23.1 months vs. 17.0 months, p=0.002). Patients whose pancreatic cancers were resected before the diagnosis of metachronous tumors had a better OS than patients whose pancreatic cancer resected after the diagnosis of metachronous tumors (48.9 months and 13.5 months, p=0.001) or those whose pancreatic cancers were resected synchronously with non-pancreas tumors (19.1 months, p=0.043). The OS of pancreatic cancer patients with stomach (33.9 months, p=0.032) and thyroid (117.8 months, p=0.049) cancers was significantly better than those with pancreas cancer only (17.0 months). CONCLUSION: About 8% of resected pancreatic cancers had associated double primary tumors, and those from the colorectum, stomach, lung, and thyroid were common. Patients whose pancreatic cancer was resected before the diagnosis of metachronous tumors had better OS than those resected after the diagnosis of metachronous tumors or those resected synchronously.

Thyroid malignancies are one of the fastest growing cancers in the world, with the majority being papillary thyroid cancer. Follicular variant of papillary thyroid cancer accounts for about 10%-20% of papillary thyroid carcinomas. The usual sites for metastases of these tumours are lungs and bones with renal metastases being extremely rare. We describe a case of a 64-year-old woman who presented with abdominal pain. On subsequent imaging, she was found to have a colonic mass with metastatic lesions in the lungs and tumour involving left kidney. On biopsy and immunohistochemical staining, the renal mass showed positivity for thyroid cancer markers. Thyroid scan was noted to be negative and the patient was placed on active surveillance after undergoing chemotherapy for colonic adenocarcinoma.

Lynch syndrome (LS) patients with isolated PMS2 loss in the colon cancer, while intact MMR in the prostate cancer, are exceedingly rare. Herein, we report such a case. A 71-year-old male was found to have increased serum PSA (10 ng/ml) after treatment for his urinary tract infection. Prostate biopsies showed foci of prostate cancer with Gleason score 7 (3+4) (grade grope 2) involving 10% of two cores. Through work up for treatment of the prostate cancer, he was found to have focal thickening of his sigmoid colon with adjacent lymphadenopathy in CT scans. Colon biopsy showed a tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia and deep invasive carcinoma could not be excluded. A low anterior resection of the rectosigmoid colon was performed and a sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma (pT2N1b, AJCC 8th edition) was confirmed. Immunostaining showed that the colon cancer was positive for CDX2, SATB2, had a loss of PMS2 and intact expression of MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6, negative for AMACR, while the prostate cancer was positive for AMACR, had intact expression of PMS2, MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6, and negative for CDX2 and SATB2. MSI-H phenotype and PMS2 mutation in the colon cancer were confirmed by microsatellite instability (MSI) PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS), respectively. Through genetic counseling and analysis of the family pedigree, LS was confirmed with colon cancer present in multiple maternal family members and his brother also had metachronous colon and prostate cancers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first documented case of synchronous colon and prostate cancers, with isolated PMS2 loss present in the colon cancer while intact DNA mismatch repair (MMR) protein expressions present in the prostate cancer, in the English literature. The pathogenesis, diagnosis and prognosis of this entity are discussed.

BACKGROUND: Lymph node extracapsular extension (ECE) is a known adverse prognostic factor in head and neck cancer and is an indication for adjuvant chemoradiation (CRT). However, the extent of ECE may provide additional prognostic information in the setting of adjuvant CRT. METHODS: This study included 350 patients with oral cavity cancer (72.6%) or bulky/nonfunctional laryngeal cancer (27.4%) who underwent initial surgical resection. Extent of ECE was graded from 0 to 4 based on the scale established by Lewis and colleagues. Multivariable analyses (MVA) were adjusted for primary site, pathologic risk factors, and adjuvant therapy. RESULTS: In univariate failure-free survival (FFS) analysis, there was no significant difference in FFS for patients with lymph node-positive disease and no ECE (grade 0) versus patients with ECE grades 1 through 3. However, patients with ECE grade 4 had significantly worse FFS. In MVA for FFS, differences between ECE grades 0 through 3 and grade 4 did not remain significant. In MVA of overall survival, ECE grade 4 was significantly associated with higher risk of death compared with ECE grade 0 (hazard ratio, 0.46; P = .02) and ECE grades 1 through 3 (HR, 0.41; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: Dichotomous evaluation of ECE is useful for determining appropriate adjuvant therapy but has limited additional prognostic value in the setting of adjuvant CRT. The detrimental effect of ECE grades 1 through 3 relative to no ECE is effectively mitigated with adjuvant CRT, but ECE grade 4 retains a poorer prognosis despite CRT with regard to overall survival. Patients with ECE grade 4 may be candidates for trials investigating novel methods of adjuvant therapy intensification.

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of disease-free prostate (PC), kidney (KC), and bladder cancer (BC) survivors with that of the general population. Materials and Methods: Our study included 331 urological cancer (UC) survivors (114 PC, 108 KC, and 109 BC) aged >/= 50 years disease-free for at least 1 year after surgery. The control group included 1,177 subjects without a history of cancer. The HRQoL was assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30, the Duke-UNC Functional Social Support Questionnaire, and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of any of the functioning sub-scales and symptoms, except significantly lower social functioning observed in BC survivors than that observed in KC survivors. Although the three groups of UC survivors showed essentially similar functioning sub-scales and symptoms when compared to the general population, PC and BC survivors showed significantly lower social functioning and a lower appetite than that observed in controls. KC survivors showed lower physical functioning, as well as higher pain and dyspnea. Although all three groups of UC survivors reported higher financial difficulties, they also reported higher perceived social support than that reported by the non-cancer control group. No statistically significant difference was observed in terms of depressive symptoms between each group of UC survivors and the general population. CONCLUSION: Disease-free survivors of the three major types of UCs showed generally similar HRQoL compared to the general population, as well as compared to each other.

BACKGROUND: Infections and antibiotic resistance patterns in patients attending regional Australian cancer centres are poorly described. AIMS: To document patient characteristics, infection types, patterns of antibiotic resistance and outcomes in all patients with cancer requiring inpatient management for suspected infection at a regional Australian cancer centre. METHODS: We studied patients >/=18 years of age who were admitted under the oncology unit at Albury Wodonga Health during a 12-month period and who had a microbiological test performed for suspected infection during their admission. Data were extracted retrospectively from electronic records and analysed through descriptive statistics. RESULTS: We identified 275 episodes of suspected infection occurring in 208 patients (M/F: 61%/39%). Median age was 68 years, solid tumour 76%, haematological malignancy 24%. A positive culture was obtained in 28% of cases: Gram-positive 48.5% and Gram-negative 51.5%. Drug resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa was seen in 38% (5/13) of pseudomonas isolates, three times the rate seen in general hospital admissions. Extended spectrum beta lactamase was seen in 22% of Gram-negative isolates. Empiric IV antibiotic choice was guideline concordant in 61% of neutropenic fever (NF) (NF) presentations. Only 17% of NF presentations received antibiotics within the recommended hour of emergency department triage. The inpatient mortality rate was 3%. Fifty-seven percent of NF presentations satisfied Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer risk index criteria for outpatient management. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study of this type in patients with cancer at an Australian regional cancer centre. The study highlighted key areas for improvement in antibiotic prescription and control of antibiotic resistance at our institution.

The identification of optimal drug administration schedules to battle the emergence of resistance is a major challenge in cancer research. The existence of a multitude of resistance mechanisms necessitates administering drugs in combination, significantly complicating the endeavor of predicting the evolutionary dynamics of cancers and optimal intervention strategies. A thorough understanding of the important determinants of cancer evolution under combination therapies is therefore crucial for correctly predicting treatment outcomes. Here we developed the first computational strategy to explore pharmacokinetic and drug interaction effects in evolutionary models of cancer progression, a crucial step towards making clinically relevant predictions. We found that incorporating these phenomena into our multiscale stochastic modeling framework significantly changes the optimum drug administration schedules identified, often predicting nonintuitive strategies for combination therapies. We applied our approach to an ongoing phase Ib clinical trial (TATTON) administering AZD9291 and selumetinib to EGFR-mutant lung cancer patients. Our results suggest that the schedules used in the three trial arms have almost identical efficacies, but slight modifications in the dosing frequencies of the two drugs can significantly increase tumor cell eradication. Interestingly, we also predict that drug concentrations lower than the MTD are as efficacious, suggesting that lowering the total amount of drug administered could lower toxicities while not compromising on the effectiveness of the drugs. Our approach highlights the fact that quantitative knowledge of pharmacokinetic, drug interaction, and evolutionary processes is essential for identifying best intervention strategies. Our method is applicable to diverse cancer and treatment types and allows for a rational design of clinical trials. Cancer Res; 77(14); 3908-21. (c)2017 AACR.

Purpose: Little is known about the role of the immune system in the earliest stages of breast carcinogenesis. We studied quantitative differences in immune cell types between breast tissues from normal donors and those from women with benign breast disease (BBD).Experimental Design: A breast tissue matched case-control study was created from donors to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure Tissue Bank (KTB) and from women diagnosed with BBD at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) who either subsequently developed cancer (BBD cases) or remained cancer-free (BBD controls). Serial tissue sections underwent immunostaining and digital quantification of cell number per mm(2) for CD4(+) T cells, CD8(+) T cells, CD20(+) B cells, and CD68(+) macrophages and quantification of positive pixel measure for CD11c (dendritic cells).Results: In 94 age-matched triplets, BBD lobules showed greater densities of CD8(+) T cells, CD11c(+) dendritic cells, CD20(+) B cells, and CD68(+) macrophages compared with KTB normals. Relative to BBD controls, BBD cases had lower CD20(+) cell density (P = 0.04). Nearly 42% of BBD cases had no CD20(+) B cells in evaluated lobules compared with 28% of BBD controls (P = 0.02). The absence of CD20(+) cells versus the presence in all lobules showed an adjusted OR of 5.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.4-23.1) for subsequent breast cancer risk.Conclusions: Elevated infiltration of both innate and adaptive immune effectors in BBD tissues suggests an immunogenic microenvironment. The reduced B-cell infiltration in women with later breast cancer suggests a role for B cells in preventing disease progression and as a possible biomarker for breast cancer risk.

While immune suppression is a hallmark of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HSNCC), the immunological impact of premalignant oral lesions, which often precedes development of HNSCC, is unknown. The present study assessed the changes in splenic and draining lymph node CD4(+) cell populations and their production of select cytokines that occur in mice with carcinogen-induced premalignant oral lesions and the changes that occur as lesions progress to oral cancer. These studies found skewing toward Th1 and Th17-type phenotypes in the spleen and lymph nodes of mice with premalignant oral lesions and a shift to Treg as lesions progress to cancer. Since the role of Th17 cells in the progression from premalignant lesions to cancer is not clear, studies determined the immunological and clinical effect of treating mice bearing premalignant oral lesions with a TGF-beta type 1 receptor inhibitor plus IL-23 as an approach to sustain the Th17 phenotype. These studies showed that the treatment approach not only sustained the Th17 phenotype, but also increased distal spleen cell and regional lymph node cell production of other stimulatory/inflammatory mediators and slowed premalignant lesion progression to cancer.

OBJECTIVE: To present methodological issues that can arise with the assessment of the risk of a second primary cancer (SPC) occurring in the same site as a first cancer using registry data. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Data from ten French cancer registries were used, including data for patients with a first prostate cancer (in males), breast cancer (in females), and colon, lung and kidney cancer (in both sexes) diagnosed between 1989 and 2004. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of SPC were computed by excluding, or not, the risk of an SPC at the same site. RESULTS: For prostate cancer, the SIR dropped from 1.11 to 0.72 when the risk of SPC of the prostate was included. SIRs increased from 1.36 to 1.45, from 1.14 to 1.21, from 1.57 to 2.01, and from 1.37 to 1.51 for breast, colon, lung, and kidney respectively. CONCLUSION: The inclusion, or not, of an SPC at the same site can impact on SPC risk estimates.

Background: While brain metastases (BM) are the most common causes of neurologic disorders in patients with known systemic malignancies, they can often be the initial manifestations of an undetected primary elsewhere. BM are major causes of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients. Aims: We describe a mixed population (data from both retrospective and prospective collection) having a BM from a solid tumor. We report the percentage distribution of the most frequent types of BM, confirming the data published in the literature. This paper may play a role in presenting the Southeast Asian reality compared with the Western countries. Setting: A tertiary-care cancer centre. Materials and Methods: Data for 4 years were retrieved from the records of the Department of Pathology of our institute. Hematolymphoid and meningeal tumors were excluded. Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) stained slides were reviewed, and in cases with an unknown primary, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was advised. The panel of markers was chosen based on the histomorphology on H and E sections. IHC was done in cases with an unknown primary where paraffin blocks were available. Results: Lung cancer was found to be the most common primary malignancy (n = 30; 48.4%) followed by breast cancer (n = 13; 21%), colorectal cancer (n = 6; 9.6%), and skin cancer (melanoma) [n = 3; 4.8%]. Conclusion: The incidence of BM from lung and breast cancer was similar to that seen in the Western studies. However, BM from colorectal cancer and melanoma show a higher and lower incidence, respectively, in comparison with the Western literature.

OBJECTIVE: Preventive breast surgery and MRI screening are offered to unaffected BRCA mutation carriers. The clinical benefit of these two modalities has not been evaluated among mutation carriers with a history of ovarian cancer. Thus, we sought to determine whether or not BRCA mutation carriers with ovarian cancer would benefit from preventive mastectomy or from MRI screening. METHODS: First, the annual mortality rate for ovarian cancer patients was estimated for a cohort of 178 BRCA mutation carriers from Ontario, Canada. Next, the actuarial risk of developing breast cancer was estimated using an international registry of 509 BRCA mutation carriers with ovarian cancer. A series of simulations was conducted to evaluate the reduction in the probability of death (from all causes) associated with mastectomy and with MRI-based breast surveillance. Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the impacts of mastectomy and MRI screening on breast cancer incidence as well as on all-cause mortality. RESULTS: Twenty (3.9%) of the 509 patients developed breast cancer within ten years following ovarian cancer diagnosis. The actuarial risk of developing breast cancer at ten years post-diagnosis, conditional on survival from ovarian cancer and other causes of mortality was 7.8%. Based on our simulation results, among all BRCA mutation-carrying patients diagnosed with stage III/IV ovarian cancer at age 50, the chance of dying before age 80 was reduced by less than 1% with MRI and by less than 2% with mastectomy. Greater improvements in survival with MRI or mastectomy were observed for women who had already survived 10years after ovarian cancer, and for women with stage I or II ovarian cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Among BRCA mutation-carrying ovarian cancer patients without a personal history of breast cancer, neither preventive mastectomy nor MRI screening is warranted, except for those who have survived ovarian cancer without recurrence for ten years and for those with early stage ovarian cancer.

Obesity later in adulthood is associated with increased risks of many cancers. However, the effect of body fatness in early adulthood, and change in weight from early to later adulthood on cancer risk later in life is less clear. We used data from 13,901 people aged 45-64 in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities cohort who at baseline (1987-1989) self-reported their weight at the age of 25 and had weight and height measured. Incident cancers were identified through 2006 and cancer deaths were ascertained through 2009. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to relate body mass index (BMI) at age 25 and percent weight change from age 25 to baseline to cancer incidence and mortality. After adjusting for weight change from age 25 until baseline, a 5 kg/m(2) increment in BMI at age 25 was associated with a greater risk of incidence of all cancers in women [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 1.10 (1.02-1.20)], but not in men. Associations with incident endometrial cancer were strong [1.83 (1.47-2.26)]. After adjusting for BMI at age 25, a 5% increment in weight from age 25 to baseline was associated with a greater risk of incident postmenopausal breast cancer [1.05 (1.02-1.07)] and endometrial cancer [1.09 (1.04-1.14)] in women and incident colorectal cancer [1.05 (1.00-1.10)] in men. Excess weight during young adulthood and weight gain from young to older adulthood may be independently associated with subsequent cancer risk. Excess weight and weight gain in early adulthood should be avoided.

Molecular targeted therapies are revolutionized therapeutics which interfere with specific molecules to block cancer growth, progression, and metastasis. Many molecular targeted therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have demonstrated remarkable clinical success in the treatment of a myriad of cancer types including breast, leukemia, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancers. This review provides an update on the different types of molecular targeted therapies used in the treatment of cancer, focusing on the fundamentals of molecular targeted therapy, its mode of action in cancer treatment, as well as its advantages and limitations.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the link between the risks of most frequent cancer sites in Poland and selected socioeconomic variables that potentially affect health outcomes throughout the life course. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional ecological study. Incidence of lung, breast, and colon cancer by voivodeships in 2014 was calculated based on Polish National Cancer Registry. Socioeconomic variables in individual voivodeships were assessed based on Polish Social Cohesion Survey for 2015. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to test the association of incidence rates and socioeconomic variables. The significance level was set at p < 0.05 (two-tailed tests). RESULTS: Statistically significant negative correlation exists between: (1) friend-/neighbour-based social capital and colon and breast cancer, (2) association-based social capital and lung cancer, (3) high religiousness and lung and breast cancer, and (4) income poverty and breast cancer. Statistically significant positive correlation exists between: (1) social isolation, living conditions poverty, poverty resulting from the lack of budget balance, and lung cancer; (2) low/no involvement in religious activity and lung and breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support public health concerns over the implication of socioeconomic environment for cancer.

Cancer is the second leading cause of death among American Indians and Alaskan Natives (AIAN), although cancer survival information in this population is limited, particularly among urban AIAN. In this retrospective cohort study, we compared all-cause and prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal cancer-specific mortality among AIAN (n = 582) and non-Hispanic white (NHW; n = 82,696) enrollees of Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) diagnosed with primary invasive breast, prostate, lung, or colorectal cancer from 1997 to 2015. Tumor registry and other electronic health records provided information on sociodemographic, comorbidity, tumor, clinical, and treatment characteristics. Cox regression models were used to estimate adjusted survival curves and hazard ratios (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). AIAN had a significantly higher comorbidity burden compared with NHW (P < 0.05). When adjusting for patient, disease characteristics, and Charlson comorbidity scores, all-cause mortality and cancer-specific mortality were significantly higher for AIAN than NHW patients with breast cancer (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.13-1.92) or with prostate cancer (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.14-3.06) but not for AIAN patients with lung and colorectal cancer. Despite approximately equal access to preventive services and cancer care in this setting, we found higher mortality for AIAN than NHW with some cancers, and a greater proportion of AIAN cancer patients with multiple comorbid conditions. This study provides severely needed information on the cancer experience of the 71% of AIANs who live in urban areas and access cancer care outside of the Indian Health Services, from which the vast majority of AIAN cancer information comes.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating evidence suggests that exercise is effective in treating many of the acute and chronic side effects of anti-cancer therapy. A recent meta-analysis supported the use of exercise to prevent or treat fatigue and lymphoedema and to improve functional status in breast cancer patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This trial was intended as a controlled, prospective feasibility study evaluating the impact of physical exercise (PE) in cancer patients during and after treatment with radio- and chemotherapy. Inclusion criteria were previous or ongoing treatment for cancer, motivation for PE of 0.5-1hour duration at least twice weekly for at least 3 months. Continuation of PE was encouraged thereafter. Every three months the following endpoints were assessed: Peak oxygen consumption as measured by supervised cardiopulmonary exercise test, body composition and quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients were included with a median age of 49 years. Forty were female and five male. Cancer types were: Breast cancer (n = 30/67 %), gastrointestinal cancer (n = 5/12 %), other types (n = 10/22 %). Thirty-eight (84 %) of the patients were included during curative treatment of their disease. Seven (16 %) were considered palliative. Adherence to the PE-programme longer than 6 months was noted for 41/45 (91 %) of the patients. Intensity of PE was thrice weekly in 32/45 (71 %), twice weekly in 11/45 (24 %). Two of 45 patients (5 %) had no PE. Mean peak oxygen consumption increased from 18.8 +/- 5.6 ml/min/kg to 20.5 +/- 3 ml/min/kg and 19.9 +/- 4.7 ml/min/kg at 3 months (p = 0.005) and 12 months (p = 0.003), respectively. Median fat mass decreased from 30.7 +/- 15 kg to 28.9 +/- 15 kg and 29.5 +/- 13 kg at 3 months (p = 0.001) and 12 months (p = 0.017), respectively. Global health status scores increased from a median baseline value of 54.9 +/- 16.3 to 66.4 +/- 14 % and 68.0 +/- 20.3 % at 3 months (p = 0.001) and 12 months (p = 0.002), respectively. CONCLUSION: This exercise programme in cancer patients with 2-3 weekly supervised sessions over three months was well feasible and demonstrated measurable improvement of oxygen consumption, body composition and quality of life. In addition, a 90 %-adherence rate to the PE-programme beyond 6 months was encouraging. Further randomized prospective data in a larger patient population will be collected comparing the impact of two versus four months supervision.

AIM: The influence of schizophrenic patients' functional disability on cancer screening participation worldwide is unclear. There are few findings on the disparities in schizophrenic patients' participation in cancer screening programs in Asia. The aim of this study was to investigate the screening rate and the associations between screening and symptom severity/functional disability in patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in a psychiatric hospital outpatient clinic in Japan. We recruited schizophrenic patients meeting the national program criteria for cancer screening for colorectal, gastric, lung, breast, and cervical cancer (n = 224, 223, 224, 110, and 175, respectively). Receipt of cancer screenings was assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Scores on the modified Global Assessment of Functioning (mGAF) were evaluated by participants' primary psychiatrists. RESULTS: Rates of cancer screenings were as follows: 24.1% for colorectal, 21.5% for gastric, 30.8% for lung, 25.5% for breast, and 19.4% for cervical cancer. A multivariable logistic analysis showed that a 1-point increase in severity/disability (100 minus mGAF score) was associated with significantly lower odds ratios (OR) for receipt of cancer screenings, except for breast cancer (OR, 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.93-0.98 for colorectal; OR, 0.96, 95%CI, 0.93-0.98 for gastric; OR, 0.95, 95%CI, 0.93-0.97 for lung; OR, 0.97, 95%CI, 0.94-1.00 for breast; and OR, 0.95, 95%CI, 0.92-0.98 for cervical cancer). CONCLUSION: The findings demonstrated low rates of cancer screenings in schizophrenic patients in Japan. Our study suggests the need to encourage attendance at cancer screenings, especially in schizophrenic patients with severe symptoms/functional disability.

BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the impact of travel distance to the treating facility on the risk of overall mortality (OM) among US patients with prostate cancer (PCa). METHODS: In total, 775,999 patients who had PCa in all stages and received treatment with different strategies (radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, observation, androgen-deprivation therapy, multimodal treatment, and chemotherapy) were drawn from the National Cancer Data Base from 2004 through 2012. Independent predictors of travel distance (intermediate [12.5-49.9 miles] and long [49.9-249.9 miles] vs short[<12.5 miles]) and its effect on OM were calculated using multivariable regression analyses. Additional analyses evaluated the distance effect on OM in selected subgroups. RESULTS: In total, 54.5%, 33.4%, and 12.1% of patients traveled short, intermediate, and long distances, respectively. Residency in rural areas and the receipt of treatment at academic/high-volume centers independently predicted long travel distance. Non-Hispanic black men and Medicaid-insured men were less likely to travel long distances (all P < .001). Overall, traveling a long distance (hazard ratio, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-0.92; P < .001) was associated with lower OM risk compared with traveling a short distance. This held true among non-Hispanic white men; privately insured and Medicare-insured men; those who underwent radical prostatectomy, received radiation therapy, and received multimodal strategies; and those who received treatment at academic/high-volume centers (P < .01), but not among non-Hispanic black men (P = .3). Long travel distance was associated with an increased OM in Medicaid-insured patients (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: An OM benefit was observed among men who traveled long distances for PCa treatment, which is likely to be a reflection of centralization of care and more favorable patient-level characteristics in those travelers. Furthermore, the survival benefit mediated by long travel distances appears to be influenced by baseline socioeconomic, treatment, and facility-level factors. Cancer 2017;123:3241-52.

Several pieces of evidence support the role of activated platelets in the development of the chronic inflammation-related diseases, such as atherothrombosis and cancer, mainly via the release of soluble factors and microparticles (MPs). Platelets and MPs contain a repertoire of proteins and genetic material (i.e., mRNAs and microRNAs) which may be influenced by the clinical condition of the individuals. In fact, platelets are capable of up-taking proteins and genetic material during their lifespan. Moreover, the content of platelet-derived MPs can be delivered to other cells, including stromal, immune, epithelial, and cancer cells, to change their phenotype and functions, thus contributing to cancer promotion and its metastasization. Platelets and MPs can play an indirect role in the metastatic process by helping malignant cells to escape from immunological surveillance. Furthermore, platelets and their derived MPs represent a potential source for blood biomarker development in oncology. This review provides an updated overview of the roles played by platelets and MPs in cancer and metastasis formation. The possible analysis of platelet and MP molecular signatures for the detection of cancer and monitoring of anticancer treatments is discussed. Finally, the potential use of MPs as vectors for drug delivery systems to cancer cells is put forward.

BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in prostate cancer treatment and outcomes are widespread and poorly understood. In the current study, the authors sought to determine whether access to care, measured across multiple dimensions, contributed to racial differences in prostate cancer. METHODS: The Philadelphia Area Prostate Cancer Access Study (P(2) Access) included 2374 men diagnosed with localized prostate cancer between 2012 and 2014. Men were surveyed to assess their experiences accessing care (response rate of 51.1%). The authors determined appointment availability at 151 urology practices using simulated patient telephone calls and calculated travel distances using geospatial techniques. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the association between 5 different domains of access (availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability, and acceptability) and receipt of treatment, perceived quality of care, and physician-patient communication. RESULTS: There were 1907 non-Hispanic white and 394 black men in the study cohort. Overall, approximately 85% of the men received definitive treatment with no differences noted by race. Black men were less likely to report a high quality of care (69% vs 81%; P<.001) and good physician-patient communication (60% vs 71%; P<.001) compared with white men. In adjusted models, none of the 5 domains of access were found to be associated with definitive treatment overall or with radical prostatectomy. All access domains were associated with perceived quality of care and communication, although these domains did not mediate racial disparities. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the current study presents the first comprehensive assessment of prostate cancer care access, treatment, and patient experience, demonstrating that although access was related to overall perceived quality of care and better physician-patient communication, it did not appear to explain observed racial differences.

One of the challenges for Latin American countries is to include in their healthcare systems technologies that can be applied to hereditary cancer detection and management. The aim of the study is to create and validate a questionnaire to identify individuals with possible risk for hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes (HCPS), using different strategies in a Cancer Prevention Service in Brazil. The primary screening questionnaire (PSQ) was developed to identify families at-risk for HCPS. The PSQ was validated using discrimination measures, and the reproducibility was estimated through kappa coefficient. Patients with at least one affirmative answer had the pedigree drawn using three alternative interview approaches: in-person, by telephone, or letter. Validation of these approaches was done. Kappa and intraclass correlation coefficients were used to analyze data's reproducibility considering the presence of clinical criteria for HCPS. The PSQ was applied to a convenience sample of 20,000 women of which 3121 (15.6%) answered at least one affirmative question and 1938 had their pedigrees drawn. The PSQ showed sensitivity and specificity scores of 94.4% and 75%, respectively, and a kappa of 0.64. The strategies for pedigree drawing had reproducibility coefficients of 0.976 and 0.850 for the telephone and letter approaches, respectively. Pedigree analysis allowed us to identify 465 individuals (24.0%) fulfilling at least one clinical criterion for HCPS. The PSQ fulfills its function, allowing the identification of HCPS at-risk families. The use of alternative screening methods may reduce the number of excluded at-risk individuals/families who live in locations where oncogenetic services are not established.

In Denmark, patients with serious nonspecific symptoms and signs of cancer (NSSC) are referred to the diagnostic outpatient clinics (DOCs) where an accelerated cancer diagnostic program is initiated. Various immunological and inflammatory biomarkers have been associated with cancer, including soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) pentraxin-3, mannose-binding lectin, ficolin-1, ficolin-2 and ficolin-3. We aimed to evaluate these biomarkers and compare their diagnostic ability to classical biomarkers for diagnosing cancer in patients with NSSC. Patients were included from the DOC, Department of Infectious Diseases, Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre. Patients were given a final diagnosis based on the combined results from scans, blood work and physical examination. Weight loss, Charlson score and previous cancer were registered on admission, and plasma concentrations of biomarkers were measured. The primary outcome was incident cancer within 1 year. Out of 197 patients included, 39 patients (19.8%) were diagnosed with cancer. Patients with cancer were significantly older and had a higher burden of comorbidities and previous cancer diagnoses compared to patients who were not diagnosed with cancer. Previous cancer, C-reactive protein (CRP) and suPAR were significantly associated with newly diagnosed cancer during follow-up in multiple logistic regression analyses adjusted for age, sex and CRP. Neither any of the PRRs investigated nor self-reported weight loss was associated with cancer. In this study, previous cancer, CRP and suPAR were significantly associated with cancer diagnosis in patients with NSSC. Ficolin-1-3, MBL and pentraxin-3 were not associated with cancer.

BACKGROUND: Transgender people and persons with disorders of sex development (DSD) are two separate categories of gender minorities, each characterized by unique cancer risk factors. Although cancer registry data typically include only two categories of sex, registrars have the option of indicating that a patient is transgender or has a DSD. METHODS: Data for primary cancer cases in 46 states and the District of Columbia were obtained from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) database for the period 1995-2013. The distributions of primary sites and categories of cancers with shared risk factors were examined separately for transgender and DSD patients and compared to the corresponding distributions in male and female cancer patients. Proportional incidence ratios were calculated by dividing the number of observed cases by the number of expected cases. Expected cases were calculated based on the age- and year of diagnosis-specific proportions of cases in each cancer category observed among male and female patients. RESULTS: Transgender patients have significantly elevated proportional incidence ratios (95% confidence intervals) for viral infection induced cancers compared to either males (2.3; 2.0-2.7) or females (3.3; 2.8-3.7). Adult DSD cancer patients have a similar distribution of primary sites compared to male or female patients but DSD children with cancer have ten times more cases of testicular malignancies than expected (95% confidence interval: 4.7-20). CONCLUSION: The proportions of certain primary sites and categories of malignancies among transgender and DSD cancer patients are different from the proportions observed for male or female patients.

FoxO transcription factors serve as the central regulator of cellular homeostasis and are tumor suppressors in human cancers. Recent studies have revealed that, besides their classic functions in promoting cell death and inducing cell cycle arrest, FoxOs also regulate cancer metabolism, an emerging hallmark of cancer. In this review, we summarize the regulatory mechanisms employed to control FoxO activities in the context of cancer biology, and discuss FoxO function in metabolism reprogramming in cancer and interaction with other key cancer metabolism pathways. A deeper understanding of FoxOs in cancer metabolism may reveal novel therapeutic opportunities in cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Cancer risk in secondary aluminium production is not well described. Workers in this industry are exposed to potentially carcinogenic agents from secondary smelters that reprocess aluminium scrap. AIMS: To evaluate cancer risk in workers in a secondary aluminium plant in Spain. METHODS: Retrospective cohort study of male workers employed at an aluminium secondary smelter (1960-92). Exposure histories and vital status through 2011 were obtained through personal interviews and hospital records, respectively. Standardized mortality (SMRs) and incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated. RESULTS: The study group consisted of 98 workers. We found increased incidence and mortality from bladder cancer [SIR = 2.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23-5.62; SMR = 5.90, 95% CI 1.58-15.11]. Increased incidence was also observed for prostate cancer and all other cancers but neither were statistically significant. No increased risk was observed for lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Results of this study suggest that work at secondary aluminium smelters is associated with bladder cancer risk. Identification of occupational carcinogens in this industry is needed.

PURPOSE: Patients with cancer frequently experience symptoms such as fatigue and pain that can influence their ability to maintain their usual physical activity (PA). This study aimed to evaluate whether symptoms of fatigue and pain are associated with decreased PA among patients with cancer. METHODS: We recruited patients with a cancer diagnosis from one academic medical center and 11 affiliated community hospitals to participate in a cross-sectional survey. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to examine the association between symptoms, demographics, and clinical characteristics and decreased PA since cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 629 participants, 499 (79%) reported a decreased level of PA since their cancer diagnosis. In the past 7 days from the time of the survey, 78% of participants reported moderate to very severe fatigue, and 68% reported a pain level 4 or greater on a scale of 0 to 10. Adjusted for covariates, patients with fatigue (Adjusted Odds Ratio, AOR 4.01, 95% CI 2.41-6.65) and pain (AOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.14-3.12) had higher odds of reporting decreased PA since diagnosis. Receipt of chemotherapy or currently receiving active cancer treatment was also associated with decreased PA (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Fatigue and pain are associated with decreased PA among patients with cancer, even after adjusting for cancer treatment. Interventions focused on managing these symptoms may help promote maintenance of PA throughout cancer treatment and beyond.

BACKGROUND: The American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) collaborate annually to provide updated information regarding cancer occurrence and trends in the United States. This year's report includes trends in colorectal cancer (CRC) incidence and death rates and highlights the use of microsimulation modeling as a tool for interpreting past trends and projecting future trends to assist in cancer control planning and policy decisions. METHODS: Information regarding invasive cancers was obtained from the NCI, CDC, and NAACCR; and information on deaths was obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Annual percentage changes in the age-standardized incidence and death rates (based on the year 2000 US population standard) for all cancers combined and for the top 15 cancers were estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term trends (1975-2006) and for short-term fixed-interval trends (1997-2006). All statistical tests were 2-sided. RESULTS: Both incidence and death rates from all cancers combined significantly declined (P < .05) in the most recent time period for men and women overall and for most racial and ethnic populations. These decreases were driven largely by declines in both incidence and death rates for the 3 most common cancers in men (ie, lung and prostate cancers and CRC) and for 2 of the 3 leading cancers in women (ie, breast cancer and CRC). The long-term trends for lung cancer mortality in women had smaller and smaller increases until 2003, when there was a change to a nonsignificant decline. Microsimulation modeling demonstrates that declines in CRC death rates are consistent with a relatively large contribution from screening and with a smaller but demonstrable impact of risk factor reductions and improved treatments. These declines are projected to continue if risk factor modification, screening, and treatment remain at current rates, but they could be accelerated further with favorable trends in risk factors and higher utilization of screening and optimal treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although the decrease in overall cancer incidence and death rates is encouraging, rising incidence and mortality for some cancers are of concern.

BACKGROUND: It is widely known that outcomes after cancer surgery vary widely, depending on interactions between patient, tumor, neoadjuvant therapy, and provider factors. Within this complex milieu, the influence of complications on the cost of surgical oncology care remains unknown. The authors examined rates of Patient Safety Indicator (PSI) occurrence for 6 cancer operations and their association with costs of care. METHODS: The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) PSI definitions were used to identify patient safety-related complications in Medicare claims data. Hospital and inpatient physician claims for the years 2005 through 2009 were analyzed for 6 cancer resections: colectomy, rectal resection, pulmonary lobectomy, pneumonectomy, esophagectomy, and pancreatic resection. Risk-adjusted regression analyses were used to measure the association between each PSI and hospitalization costs. RESULTS: Overall PSI rates ranged from a low of 0.01% for postoperative hip fracture to a high of 2.58% for respiratory failure. Death among inpatients with serious treatable complications, postoperative respiratory failure, postoperative thromboembolism, and accidental puncture/laceration were >1% for all 6 cancer operations. Several PSIs-including decubitus ulcer, death among surgical inpatients with serious treatable complications, and postoperative thromboembolism-raised hospitalization costs by >/=20% for most cancer surgery types. Postoperative respiratory failure resulted in a cost increase >50% for all cancer resections. CONCLUSIONS: The consistently higher costs associated with cancer surgery PSIs indicate that substantial health care savings could be achieved by targeting these indicators for quality improvement.

BACKGROUND: A diagnosis of cancer is associated with an increased suicide risk, and this risk is the highest within the first year of diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to determine risk factors of suicide occurring within the first year of cancer diagnosis (early suicide). METHODS: The sampling pool consisted of 164,497 patients with cancer admitted to a general hospital in Seoul, South Korea, from 1996 to 2009. We conducted a 1:2 matched case-control study by matching 373 patients who died from suicide (cases) with 746 patients who did not die from suicide (controls) on age, sex, anatomic site, and at the time of cancer diagnosis. Data were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards regression modeling. RESULTS: Suicide within the first year after a cancer diagnosis occurred in 149 patients (40.0% of 373 total suicides). The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for early suicide was 1.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.40-1.94] and was significantly higher for biliary-pancreatic (SMR = 3.07; 95% CI = 2.02-4.46), lung (SMR = 1.94; 95% CI = 1.19-3.30), and stomach (SMR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.16-2.42) cancers than for other cancers. Early and late suicide was significantly different in anatomic site (p = 0.01) and stage (p < 0.001), while not significant in other demographic factors. Advanced stage was more frequent among early suicide compared with late suicide (53.4 versus 18.7%; p < 0.001). Stage of cancer was independently associated with early suicide risk. CONCLUSIONS: Cancers with an advanced stage at diagnosis were associated with an increased risk of suicide within 1 year of diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Community-based cancer organizations provide services to support patients. An anticipated benefit of these services is patient empowerment. However, this outcome has not been evaluated because of the lack of validated health-related empowerment questionnaires in the cancer context. In this validation study, the authors assessed the extent to which 16 indicators used by the Canadian Cancer Society (CCS) and the Cancer Council Victoria, Australia (CCV) to evaluate their services were associated with health-related empowerment. METHODS: Cancer patients/survivors who were diagnosed < 3 years earlier and who used CCS programs completed a questionnaire that included the 16 CCS-CCV indicators and 5 scales from the Health Education Impact Questionnaire (heiQ) measuring key dimensions of empowerment. To determine whether the CCS-CCV indicators captured empowerment, differences in heiQ scores were compared between 2 groups: those with higher levels of agreement (agreeing or agreeing strongly) with an indicator and those with lower levels of agreement (agreeing slightly or disagreeing to any degree). RESULTS: Participation was 72% (207 of 289 eligible CCS users). Compared with participants who had lower levels of agreement on CCS-CCV indicators, those who had higher levels of agreement were more likely to report higher levels of empowerment on the different heiQ scales. For 15 of 16 indicators, these differences were significant (Wilcoxon rank-sum test; P < .10) on >/= 1 of 5 heiQ scales and for 10 of 16 indicators on >/= 3 of 5 heiQ scales. Two indicators were associated significantly with all 5 heiQ scales (cope better and feel more in control). CONCLUSIONS: Using CCS-CCV indicators to evaluate community-based cancer organizations' services will help determine whether these services are reaching one of their important goals: namely empowering patients.

BACKGROUND: To date, research on stigmatization among cancer patients and related psychosocial consequences has been scarce and mostly based on small and highly selected samples. We investigated stigmatization and its impact on quality of life among a large sample including four major tumor entities. METHODS: We assessed 858 patients with breast, colon, lung or prostate cancer from two cancer registries. Stigmatization and quality of life (QoL) was assessed with the Social Impact Scale (SIS-D) and the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer), respectively. Group effects were analyzed via analyses of variance, relationships were investigated via Pearson's r and stepwise regression analyses. RESULTS: The mean age was 60.7 years, 54% were male. Across cancer sites, the dimensions of stigmatization (isolation, social rejection, financial insecurity and internalized shame) were in the lower and middle range, with the highest values found for isolation. Stigmatization was lowest among prostate cancer patients. Stigmatization predicted all five areas of QoL among breast cancer patients (p < .05), but only affected emotional functioning (p < .01) among lung cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: We found an inverse relationship between perceived cancer-related stigmatization and various dimensions of QoL, with variation between cancer sites. Breast cancer patients should be focused in individual therapies regarding the negative consequences accompanied by perceived stigmatization.

BACKGROUND: Black women are more likely to experience adverse effects from cancer treatment such as lymphedema. Thus, black women may particularly benefit from research regarding interventions to improve lymphedema. Herein, the authors report the challenges and strategies related to the recruitment of minority survivors of breast cancer and to the recruitment of survivors of breast cancer with lymphedema into the Women In Steady Exercise Research (WISER) Survivor Clinical Trial. METHODS: Subjects for this community-based trial were recruited from the Philadelphia area through active (mailings) and passive (printed materials and Web site) recruitment strategies. In addition, education sessions coordinated through partner hospitals in communities with a predominantly minority population were conducted to increase awareness of lymphedema in survivors of breast cancer. Women who were interested in the study were screened for lymphedema via telephone questionnaire and invited to see a study-related certified lymphedema therapist to confirm the presence of lymphedema. RESULTS: Screening was conducted among 2295 women: 628 were eligible, 450 consented, and 351 were randomized. Minority women comprised 38% of the study population. Letters to women on state and hospital registries resulted in a 0.4% randomization rate; education sessions yielded a 10% randomization rate. The authors observed that approximately 23.6% of the study sample had no previous diagnosis of lymphedema. CONCLUSIONS: The WISER Survivor Clinical Trial faced multiple recruitment challenges and used unique strategies to successfully enroll minority survivors of breast cancer into a lifestyle intervention.

Recent studies have found that cancer-testis (CT) genes, which are expressed predominantly in germ and cancer cells, may be candidate cancer drivers. Because of their crucial roles, genetic variants in these genes may contribute to the development of cancer. Here, we systematically evaluated associations of common variants in CT genes and their promoters for the risk of lung cancer in our initial GWAS (2331 cases and 3077 controls), followed by in silico replication using additional 10,512 lung cancer cases and 9562 controls. We found a significant association between rs3747093 located in the CCDC116 promoter and lung cancer risk (OR = 0.91, P meta = 7.81 x 10(-6)). Although CCDC116 was expressed at lower levels in somatic tissues compared to the testis, the protective allele A of rs3747093 was associated with decreased CCDC116 expression in many normal tissues, including the lung (P = 8.1 x 10(-13)). We subsequently genotyped this variant in another four commonly diagnosed cancers (gastric, esophageal, colorectal, and breast cancers), as we found expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) signals for rs3747093 and CCDC116 in their corresponding normal tissues. Interestingly, we observed consistent associations between rs3747093 and multiple cancers (gastric cancer: OR = 0.85, P = 2.21 x 10(-4); esophageal cancer: OR = 0.91, P = 2.57 x 10(-2); colorectal cancer: OR = 0.80, P = 1.85 x 10(-6); and breast cancer: OR = 0.87, P = 1.55 x 10(-3)). Taken together, the A allele of rs3747093 showed significant protective effects on cancer risk (OR = 0.88, P pool = 6.52 x 10(-13)) in an Asian population. Moreover, our findings suggest that low abundance expression of CT genes in normal tissues may also contribute to tumorigenesis, providing a new mechanism of CT genes in the development of cancer.

Background: Guideline adherence remains a challenge in clinical practice, despite guidelines' ascribed potential to improve patient outcomes. We studied the level of adherence to recommendations from Dutch national cancer treatment guidelines, and the influence of general and cancer-specific guideline characteristics on adherence. Methods: Based on data from a national cancer registry, adherence was evaluated for 15 treatment recommendations for breast, colorectal, prostate and lung cancer, and melanoma. Recommendations were selected by representatives of the medical specialist associations responsible for developing and implementing the guidelines. We used multivariable multilevel analysis to calculate mean adherence and variation between individual hospitals. Results: Mean adherence to the different treatment recommendations ranged from 40 to 99%. Adherence differed only slightly between older and newer guidelines and between recommendations with low, moderate or high levels of evidence (range 79-84% and 77-91%, respectively), while adherence differed more between recommendations for different cancer types (range 54-99%), different treatment modalities (adherence ranged from 40 to 92%) or recommendations that advised against or recommended in favour of particular treatment (adherence ranged from 75 to 98%). Conclusion: We found significant variation in adherence between different cancer treatment guidelines. While some guideline characteristics that seem to explain this variation may be considered difficult to modify, the potential for variance across cancer types and treatment modalities suggests that adherence could be further improved. At the same time, these results warrant tailored strategies for the improvement of adherence to clinical practice guidelines.

BACKGROUND: Patients with bladder cancer are apt to develop multiple recurrences that require intervention. The recurrence, progression, and bladder cancer-related mortality rates were examined in a cohort of individuals with high-grade non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. METHODS: Using linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data, subjects were identified who had a diagnosis of high-grade, non-muscle-invasive disease in 1992 to 2002 and who were followed until 2007. Multivariate competing-risks regression analyses were then used to examine recurrence, progression, and bladder cancer-related mortality rates. RESULTS: Of 7410 subjects, 2897 (39.1%) experienced a recurrence without progression, 2449 (33.0%) experienced disease progression, of whom 981 succumbed to bladder cancer. Using competing-risks regression analysis, the 10-year recurrence, progression, and bladder cancer-related mortality rates were found to be 74.3%, 33.3%, and 12.3%, respectively. Stage T1 was the only variable associated with a higher rate of recurrence. Women, black race, undifferentiated grade, and stage Tis and T1 were associated with a higher risk of progression and mortality. Advanced age (>/= 70) was associated with a higher risk of bladder cancer-related mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly three-fourths of patients diagnosed with high-risk bladder cancer will recur, progress, or die within 10 years of their diagnosis. Even though most patients do not die of bladder cancer, the vast majority endures the morbidity of recurrence and progression of their cancer. Increasing efforts should be made to offer patients intravesical therapy with the goal of minimizing the incidence of recurrences. Furthermore, the high recurrence rate seen during the first 2 years of diagnosis warrants an intense surveillance schedule.

PURPOSE: Secondary primary cancers (SPCs) commonly arise in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We designed the present study to estimate the SPC incidence in Korean patients with RCC. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study cohort was population-based and consisted of 40,347 individuals from the Korean Central Cancer Registry who were diagnosed with primary renal cancer between 1993 and 2013. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) for SPCs were estimated for different ages at diagnosis, latencies, diagnostic periods, and treatments. RESULTS: For patients with primary RCC, the risk of developing a SPC was higher than the risk of developing cancer in the general population (SIR, 1.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.18). Most cancer types showed higher incidences in patients with RCC than in the general population. However, the relative incidence of gastric cancer as an SPC varied by age. Gastric cancer incidence was elevated in young patients (< 30 years) with RCC, but reduced in older (>/= 30) patients with RCC. Patients with advanced RCC died prematurely, regardless of SPC development. In contrast, those with early-stage RCC survived for longer periods, although SPC development affected their post-RCC survival. After SPC development, women had better survival than men. CONCLUSION: In Korean patients with primary RCC, the incidence of SPC was 13% higher than the incidence of cancer in the general population. These findings may play important roles in the conduct of follow-up evaluations and education for patients with RCC.

INTRODUCTION: The aims of the present study were to assess demographic and clinical characteristics of patients after receiving a cancer diagnosis, and to determine possible risk factors for anxiety and depression. METHODS: All consecutive patients aged 18 or above, were assessed before starting intravenous chemotherapy for the first time with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Distress Thermometer, and a Visual Analog Scale for pain. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. RESULTS: The patients assessed (n = 270) had a mean age of 59.4 (SD = 11.8) years, and 50.7% were women. Tumours were more frequently colorectal (27.2%), lung (18.8%) and breast (17.6%), and 68.9% were stages 3 or 4. A HADS Anxiety score >/=8 was present in 30% of the patients, a Depression score >/=8 in 24.1%, and a Distress score >/=4 in 44.4%. Independent risk factors for HADS Depression score >/=8 were being a woman (OR = 2.45; p = 0.004), being older (OR = 1.04; p = 0.005), and cancer stage 3-4 (OR = 2.24; p = 0.023) in the multivariable analysis; for Anxiety >/=8 they were being a woman (OR = 2.47; p = 0.002), having a past psychiatric consultation (OR = 2.83; p = 0.029), and cancer stage 3-4 (OR = 1.90; p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: These results suggest the need for greater awareness and a differentiated approach to patients at increased risk of anxiety and depression in the early stages of treatment and before starting chemotherapy.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk factors associated with lung cancer (LC) and other second neoplasms (SN) in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) survivors. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of 604 patients treated in our institution between 1968 and 2012. RESULTS: 90 out of 604 patients developed SN: 27 LC and 63 other SN. The median time elapsed until LC and other SN was 16.5 and 11.8 years, respectively (p = 0.003). In the LC group, 85.5 % of patients were male and 84.6 % smokers (HR 7, 95 % CI 2.4-20.7, p < 0.001). Radiotherapy (RT) doses applied were higher in the SN group with an increased risk of LC (HR: 4.0 95 % CI 1.1-11.6, p = 0.010) and other SN (HR: 3.3 95 % CI 1.6-6.7 p = 0.001) with doses higher than 42 Gy. No association was found between alkylating agents and development of SN. In LC, the most frequent histology was adenocarcinoma with an elapsed time after HL of 13.2 years in early stages and 21.3 in advanced (p = 0.02). Median OS after a diagnosis of LC was 12.6 months ranging from 5.9 (in cases presenting due to symptoms) to 49.1 (incidentally diagnosed cases) (p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: RT treatment, especially with doses higher than 42 Gy, and smoking increase the risk of SN after HL. In this series, LC patients with early stages had a shorter elapsed time from HL diagnosis and longer OS, therefore the role of LC screening in HL survivors should be prospectively evaluated and smoking cessation counseling ought to be a key aspect during follow-up.

Cancer is a malignant tumor that threatens the health of human beings, and has become the leading cause of death in urban and rural residents in China. The glycocalyx is a layer of multifunctional glycans that covers the surfaces of a variety of cells, including vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, stem cells, epithelial, osteocytes, as well as cancer cells. The glycosylation and syndecan of cancer cell glycocalyx are unique. However, heparan sulfate (HS), hyaluronic acid (HA), and syndecan are all closely associated with the processes of cancer progression, including cell migration and metastasis, tumor cell adhesion, tumorigenesis, and tumor growth. The possible underlying mechanisms may be the interruption of its barrier function, its radical role in growth factor storage, signaling, and mechanotransduction. In the later sections, we discuss glycocalyx targeting therapeutic approaches reported in animal and clinical experiments. The study concludes that cancer cells' glycocalyx and its role in cancer progression are beginning to be known by more groups, and future studies should pay more attention to its mechanotransduction of interstitial flow-induced shear stress, seeking promising therapeutic targets with less toxicity but more specificity.

betacatenin/CTNNB1 is an intracellular scaffold protein that interacts with adhesion molecules (Ecadherin/CDH1, Ncadherin/CDH2, VEcadherin/CDH5 and alphacatenins), transmembranetype mucins (MUC1/CD227 and MUC16/CA125), signaling regulators (APC, AXIN1, AXIN2 and NHERF1/EBP50) and epigenetic or transcriptional regulators (BCL9, BCL9L, CREBBP/CBP, EP300/p300, FOXM1, MED12, SMARCA4/BRG1 and TCF/LEF). Gainoffunction CTTNB1 mutations are detected in bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and uterine cancer, whereas lossoffunction CTNNB1 mutations are also detected in human cancer. ABCB1, ALDH1A1, ASCL2, ATF3, AXIN2, BAMBI, CCND1, CD44, CLDN1, CTLA4, DKK1, EDN1, EOMES, FGF18, FGF20, FZD7, IL10, JAG1, LEF1, LGR5, MITF, MSX1, MYC, NEUROD1, NKD1, NODAL, NOTCH2, NOTUM, NRCAM, OPN, PAX3, PPARD, PTGS2, RNF43, SNAI1, SP5, TCF7, TERT, TNFRSF19, VEGFA and ZNRF3 are representative betacatenin target genes. betacatenin signaling is involved in myofibroblast activation and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis, in addition to other types of fibrosis. betacatenin and NFkappaB signaling activation are involved in field cancerization in the stomach associated with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection and in the liver associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and other etiologies. betacatenintargeted therapeutics are functionally classified into betacatenin inhibitors targeting upstream regulators (AZ1366, ETC159, G007LK, GNF6231, ipafricept, NVPTNKS656, rosmantuzumab, vantictumab, WNTC59, WNT974 and XAV939), betacatenin inhibitors targeting proteinprotein interactions (CGP049090, CWP232228, E7386, ICG001, LF3 and PRI724), betacatenin inhibitors targeting epigenetic regulators (PKF118310), betacatenin inhibitors targeting mediator complexes (CCT251545 and cortistatin A) and betacatenin inhibitors targeting transmembranetype transcriptional outputs, including CD44v6, FZD7 and LGR5. Eradicating H. pylori and HCV is the optimal approach for the firstline prevention of gastric cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), respectively. However, betacatenin inhibitors may be applicable for the prevention of organ fibrosis, secondline HCC prevention and treating betacatenindriven cancer. The multilayered prevention and treatment strategy of betacateninrelated human diseases is necessary for the practice of personalized medicine and implementation of precision medicine.

INTRODUCTION: Genetic counseling and testing is recommended for women with a personal and/or family history of breast and other cancers (ovarian, pancreatic, male breast and others). Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (BRCA1/2) are the most common causes of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Additional genetic counseling and testing with a multi-gene panel may be considered in breast cancer patients who tested negative for mutations in these two genes. In about 11% of BRCA1/2-negative patients, further genetic testing reveals pathogenic mutations in other high or moderate cancer risk genes. In 0.2% of cases, an individual may carry pathogenic mutations in more than one high penetrance gene (a double heterozygote). Finding one or more pathogenic mutations is important for cancer prevention in patients and/or their families. CASE PRESENTATION: Here we present a case of a breast cancer patient who did not have a pathogenic mutation in BRCA1/2 and had a family history of breast and stomach cancers. On an additional multi-gene panel testing, she was found to carry pathogenic mutations in the CDH1 and PMS2 genes, which cause Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer and Lynch syndromes, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first description of such a double heterozygote. DISCUSSION: Clinical manifestations, genetics, and management of both syndromes are reviewed, including prophylactic surgery and screening for unaffected family members. Management challenges for a mutation carrier with advanced breast cancer are discussed. Our case supports the clinical utility of additional multi-gene panel testing for breast cancer patients who do not have a pathogenic mutation in BRCA1/2 genes.

PIK3CA is one of the most commonly mutated genes in solid cancers. PIK3CA mutations are also found in benign overgrowth syndromes, collectively known as PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). As in cancer, PIK3CA mutations in PROS arise postzygotically, but unlike in cancer, these mutations arise during embryonic development, with their timing and location critically influencing the resulting disease phenotype. Recent evidence indicates that phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway inhibitors undergoing trials in cancer can provide a therapy for PROS. Conversely, PROS highlights gaps in our understanding of PI3K's role during embryogenesis and in cancer development. Here, we summarize current knowledge of PROS, evaluate challenges and strategies for disease modeling, and consider the implications of PROS as a paradigm for understanding activating PIK3CA mutations in human development and cancer.

PURPOSE: Few prospective studies have reported on relationships between objective periodontal disease (PD) measures and cancer risk. This association was examined in 1,337 postmenopausal women participating in the Buffalo OsteoPerio Study. METHODS: Oral alveolar crestal height (ACH) was measured using oral radiographs. Incident cancers were adjudicated with medical records. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between ACH and incident cancer outcomes were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: There were 203 confirmed total incident cancer cases during follow-up (12.2 +/- 4.2 years). After adjusting for age and smoking, there were no statistically significant associations between ACH-defined PD categories and total cancer risk (mild/moderate vs. none: HR 1.33, 95 % CI 0.91-1.94; severe vs. none: HR 1.20, 95 % CI 0.77-1.86). ACH-defined PD categories were not associated with common site-specific cancers. Whole-mouth mean and worst-site ACH (per 1 mm loss) were significantly associated with increased risk of lung (adjusted HR 1.81, 95 % CI 1.30-2.54; adjusted HR 1.34, 95 % CI 1.08-1.66, respectively), but not total or other site-specific cancer. Smoking status modified the associations between continuous ACH variables and total cancer risk; measures of PD were associated with total cancer among smokers but not never smokers (interaction p = 0.02 and p < 0.01 for whole-mouth mean and worst-site ACH, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: ACH-defined PD was associated with total cancer risk in ever but not never smoking postmenopausal women. Whole-mouth mean and worst-site ACH were associated with increased lung cancer risk. However, these results need to be interpreted cautiously given the small number of lung cancer cases (n = 18). Further research utilizing a larger sample is warranted to confirm the relationships among oral bone loss, site-specific cancers, and total cancer.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA biosynthesis genes DROSHA and DGCR8 were indicated to be correlated with cancer risk. We comprehensively reviewed and analyzed the effect of DROSHA and DGCR8 polymorphisms on cancer risk. Eligible articles were selected according to a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Consequently, ten case-control studies (from nine citations) with 4265 cancer cases and 4349 controls were involved in a meta-analysis of seven most prevalent SNPs (rs10719 T/C, rs6877842 G/C, rs2291109 A/T, rs642321 C/T, rs3757 G/A, rs417309 G/A, rs1640299 T/G). Our findings demonstrated that the rs417309 SNP in DGCR8 was significantly associated with an elevated risk of overall cancer in every genetic model. In stratified analysis, correlations of DROSHA rs10719 and rs6877842 SNPs were observed in Asian and laryngeal cancer subgroups, respectively. Moreover, associations of the rs417309 SNP could also be found in numerous subgroups including: Asian and Caucasian population subgroups; laryngeal and breast cancer subgroups; population-based (PB) and hospital-based (HB) subgroups. In conclusion, the DROSHA rs10719, rs6877842 SNPs, and DGCR8 rs417309 SNP play pivotal roles in cancerogenesis and may be potential biomarkers for cancer-forewarning.

The malignant transformation of normal cells is caused in part by aberrant gene expression disrupting the regulation of cell proliferation, apoptosis, senescence and DNA repair. Evidence suggests that the Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death (BAD)-mediated apoptotic pathway influences cancer chemoresistance. In the present study, we explored the role of the BAD-mediated apoptotic pathway in the development and progression of cancer. Using principal component analysis to derive a numeric score representing pathway expression, we evaluated clinico-genomic datasets (n=427) from corresponding normal, pre-invasive and invasive cancers of different types, such as ovarian, endometrial, breast and colon cancers in order to determine the associations between the BAD-mediated apoptotic pathway and cancer development. Immunofluorescence was used to compare the expression levels of phosphorylated BAD [pBAD (serine-112, -136 and -155)] in immortalized normal and invasive ovarian, colon and breast cancer cells. The expression of the BAD-mediated apoptotic pathway phosphatase, PP2C, was evaluated by RT-qPCR in the normal and ovarian cancer tissue samples. The growth-promoting effects of pBAD protein levels in the immortalized normal and cancer cells were assessed using siRNA depletion experiments with MTS assays. The expression of the BAD-mediated apoptotic pathway was associated with the development and/or progression of ovarian (n=106, p<0.001), breast (n=185, p<0.0008; n=61, p=0.04), colon (n=22, p<0.001) and endometrial (n=33, p<0.001) cancers, as well as with ovarian endometriosis (n=20, p<0.001). Higher pBAD protein levels were observed in the cancer cells compared to the immortalized normal cells, whereas PP2C gene expression was lower in the cancer compared to the ovarian tumor tissue samples (n=76, p<0.001). The increased pBAD protein levels after the depletion of PP2C conferred a growth advantage to the immortalized normal and cancer cells. The BAD-mediated apoptotic pathway is thus associated with the development of human cancers likely influenced by the protein levels of pBAD.

BACKGROUND: Although national guidelines do not recommend extent of disease imaging for patients with newly diagnosed early stage breast cancer given that the harm outweighs the benefits, high rates of testing have been documented. The 2012 Choosing Wisely guidelines specifically addressed this issue. We examined the change over time in imaging use across a statewide collaborative, as well as the reasons for performing imaging and the impact on cost of care. METHODS: Clinicopathologic data and use of advanced imaging tests (positron emission tomography, computed tomography, and bone scan) were abstracted from the medical records of patients treated at 25 participating sites in the Michigan Breast Oncology Quality Initiative (MiBOQI). For patients diagnosed in 2014 and 2015, reasons for testing were abstracted from the medical record. RESULTS: Of the 34,078 patients diagnosed with stage 0-II breast cancer between 2008 and 2015 in MiBOQI, 6853 (20.1%) underwent testing with at least 1 imaging modality in the 90 days after diagnosis. There was considerable variability in rates of testing across the 25 sites for all stages of disease. Between 2008 and 2015, testing decreased over time for patients with stage 0-IIA disease (all P < .001) and remained stable for stage IIB disease (P = .10). This decrease in testing over time resulted in a cost savings, especially for patients with stage I disease. CONCLUSION: Use of advanced imaging at the time of diagnosis decreased over time in a large statewide collaborative. Additional interventions are warranted to further reduce rates of unnecessary imaging to improve quality of care for patients with breast cancer. Cancer 2017;123:2975-83.

BACKGROUND: The current study compared the incidence of vascular thromboembolic events (VTEs) in patients with metastatic or unresectable urothelial carcinoma (UC) who were treated with gemcitabine and carboplatin (GCb); gemcitabine, carboplatin, and bevacizumab (GCbBev); or gemcitabine and cisplatin (GCis). METHODS: Patients with UC who were treated with GCbBev on protocol were analyzed prospectively and 2 contemporary control cohorts receiving GCb or GCis were evaluated retrospectively. VTE was defined as either venous or arterial (myocardial infarctions or cerebral vascular accidents) thrombosis. VTEs were considered to be related to treatment if they occurred during treatment or within 4 weeks of the completion of treatment. Associations with chemotherapy regimen were tested using either the Fisher exact test or Kruskal-Wallis test. Clinical factors associated with VTEs were analyzed using conditional logistic regression stratified by treatment regimen. RESULTS: Among 198 patients, VTEs occurred in 13 of 51 patients treated with GCbBev (26%), 22 of 92 patients treated with GCb (24%), and 8 of 55 patients treated with GCis (15%). Patient characteristics were significantly different between the treatment cohorts in terms of age, prior cystectomy, tumor location near pelvic vessels, Khorana risk group, and receipt of antiplatelet therapy. The incidence of VTE and type of VTE (arterial vs venous) did not differ by type of chemotherapy. Prior cystectomy was associated with an increased risk of VTE (odds ratio, 2.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-4.9 [P = .047]). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of VTE in Cis-treated patients was similar to prior reports. However, the VTE rate in Cb-treated patients was > 20%, a figure not previously defined in patients with UC and higher than expected. This high incidence of both Cis-related and Cb-related VTEs warrants greater awareness by treating physicians and deserves further study. Cancer 2016;122:712-721. (c) 2015 American Cancer Society.

The viral-transforming proteins E6 and E7 make human papillomavirus-positive (HPV(+)) malignancies an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. However, therapeutic vaccination exerts limited efficacy in the setting of advanced disease. We designed a strategy to induce substantial specific immune responses against multiple epitopes of E6 and E7 proteins based on an attenuated transgene from HPV serotypes 16 and 18 that is incorporated into MG1-Maraba virotherapy (MG1-E6E7). Mutations introduced to the transgene abrogate the ability of E6 and E7 to perturb p53 and retinoblastoma, respectively, while maintaining the ability to invoke tumor-specific, multifunctional CD8(+) T-cell responses. Boosting with MG1-E6E7 significantly increased the magnitude of T-cell responses compared with mice treated with a priming vaccine alone (greater than 50 x 10(6) E7-specific CD8(+) T cells per mouse was observed, representing a 39-fold mean increase in boosted animals). MG1-E6E7 vaccination in the HPV(+) murine model TC1 clears large tumors in a CD8(+)-dependent manner and results in durable immunologic memory. MG1-Maraba can acutely alter the tumor microenvironment in vivo and exploit molecular hallmarks of HPV(+) cancer, as demonstrated by marked infection of HPV(+) patient tumor biopsies and is, therefore, ideally suited as an oncolytic treatment against clinical HPV(+) cancer. This approach has the potential to be directly translatable to human clinical oncology to tackle a variety of HPV-associated neoplasms that cause significant morbidity and mortality globally.

Dysregulation of metabolism allows tumor cells to generate needed building blocks as well as to modulate epigenetic marks to support cancer initiation and progression. Cancer-induced metabolic changes alter the epigenetic landscape, especially modifications on histones and DNA, thereby promoting malignant transformation, adaptation to inadequate nutrition, and metastasis. Recent advances in cancer metabolism shed light on how aberrations in metabolites and metabolic enzymes modify epigenetic programs. The metabolism-induced recoding of epigenetics in cancer depends strongly on nutrient availability for tumor cells. In this review, we focus on metabolic remodeling of epigenetics in cancer and examine potential mechanisms by which cancer cells integrate nutritional inputs into epigenetic modification.

BACKGROUND: Intervention studies among individuals in diverse community settings are needed to reduce health disparities in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and mortality rates. The current study compared the efficacy of 2 intervention conditions promoting CRC screening among black individuals. METHODS: Black individuals ages 50 to 75 years (N = 330) were recruited in community settings in 4 Tampa Bay counties. After obtaining consent and conducting a baseline interview to assess sociodemographic and health-related variables, participants received either a culturally targeted CRC photonovella booklet plus a fecal immunochemical test (FIT) kit or a standard CRC screening brochure plus an FIT kit. The primary outcome was FIT kit screening uptake. RESULTS: FIT screening uptake at 6 months was 86.7% overall (90.3% in the brochure group and 81.9% in the photonovella group). Controlling for baseline between-group differences, there was no influence of intervention on FIT kit uptake (P = .756). Significant predictors of not returning an FIT kit included being unable to work (P = .010), having higher religious belief scores (P = .015), and living farther from the cancer center (P = .015). CONCLUSIONS: Providing FIT kits and educational print materials to black individuals in community settings resulted in high rates of CRC screening. The study also identified subgroups of participants who were less likely to return an FIT kit and provides insight for future interventions. Cancer 2016;122:3288-3296.

Improved survival rates among reproductive-age females diagnosed with cancer have increased the focus on long-term quality of life, including maintenance of the ability to conceive biological children. Cancer-directed therapies such as high-dose alkylating agents and radiation to the pelvis, which deplete ovarian reserve, radiation to the brain, which affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, and surgical resection of reproductive structures can decrease the likelihood of having biological children. Standard fertility preservation strategies such as embryo and oocyte cryopreservation before the onset of therapy offer the opportunity to conserve fertility, but they may not be feasible because of the urgency to start cancer therapy, financial limitations, and a lack of access to reproductive endocrinologists. Ovarian tissue freezing is considered experimental, with limited data related to pregnancies, but it minimizes treatment delay. Studies evaluating gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues have had mixed results, although a recent randomized, prospective study in women with breast cancer demonstrated a protective effect. Fertility preservation programs are increasingly being developed within cancer programs. In this article, we describe risks to infertility and options for preservation, raise psychosocial and ethical issues, and propose elements for establishing an effective fertility preservation program.

Mitochondria are essential intracellular organelles that regulate energy metabolism, cell death, and signaling pathways that are important for cell proliferation and differentiation. Therefore, mitochondria are fundamentally implicated in cancer biology, including initiation, growth, metastasis, relapse, and acquired drug resistance. Based on these implications, mitochondria have been proposed as a major therapeutic target for cancer treatment. In addition to classical view of mitochondria in cancer biology, recent studies found novel pathophysiological roles of mitochondria in cancer. In this review, we introduce recent concepts of mitochondrial roles in cancer biology including mitochondrial DNA mutation and epigenetic modulation, energy metabolism reprogramming, mitochondrial channels, involvement in metastasis and drug resistance, and cancer stem cells. We also discuss the role of mitochondria in emerging cancer therapeutic strategies, especially cancer immunotherapy and CRISPR-Cas9 system gene therapy.

Smoking cessation is crucial for reducing cancer risk and premature mortality. The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has recommended annual lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT), and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently approved lung screening as a benefit for patients ages 55 to 77 years who have a 30 pack-year history. The Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) and the Association for the Treatment of Tobacco Use and Dependence (ATTUD) developed the guideline described in this commentary based on an illustrative literature review to present the evidence for smoking-cessation health benefits in this high-risk group and to provide clinical recommendations for integrating evidence-based smoking-cessation treatment with lung cancer screening. Unfortunately, extant data on lung cancer screening participants were scarce at the time this guideline was written. However, in this review, the authors summarize the sufficient evidence on the benefits of smoking cessation and the efficacy of smoking-cessation interventions for smokers ages 55 to 77 years to provide smoking-cessation interventions for smokers who seek lung cancer screening. It is concluded that smokers who present for lung cancer screening should be encouraged to quit smoking at each visit. Access to evidence-based smoking-cessation interventions should be provided to all smokers regardless of scan results, and motivation to quit should not be a necessary precondition for treatment. Follow-up contacts to support smoking-cessation efforts should be arranged for smokers. Evidence-based behavioral strategies should be used at each visit to motivate smokers who are unwilling to try quitting/reducing smoking or to try evidence-based treatments that may lead to eventual cessation.

BACKGROUND: Direct access to genomic information has the potential to transform cancer risk counseling. We measured the impact of direct-to-consumer genomic risk information on changes to perceived risk (DeltaPR) of breast, prostate, colorectal and lung cancer among personal genomic testing (PGT) customers. We hypothesized that DeltaPR would reflect directionality of risk estimates, attenuate with time, and be modified by participant characteristics. METHODS: Pathway Genomics and 23andMe customers were surveyed prior to receiving PGT results, and 2 weeks and 6 months post-results. For each cancer, PR was measured on a 5-point ordinal scale from "much lower than average" to "much higher than average." PGT results, based on genotyping of common genetic variants, were dichotomized as elevated or average risk. The relationship between risk estimate and DeltaPR was evaluated with linear regression; generalized estimating equations modeled this relationship over time. RESULTS: With the exception of lung cancer (for which DeltaPR was positive regardless of result), elevated risk results were significantly associated with positive DeltaPR, and average risk results with negative DeltaPR (e.g., prostate cancer, 2 weeks: least squares-adjusted DeltaPR = 0.77 for elevated risk versus -0.21 for average risk; p-valuedifference < 0.0001) among 1154 participants. Large changes were rare: for each cancer, <4 % of participants overall reported a DeltaPR of +/-3 or more units. Effect modification by age, cancer family history, and baseline interest was observed for breast, colorectal, and lung cancer, respectively. A pattern of decreasing impact on DeltaPR over time was consistently observed, but this trend was significant only in the case of colorectal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: We have quantified the effect on consumer risk perception of returning genetic-based cancer risk information directly to consumers without clinician mediation. Provided via PGT, this information has a measurable but modest effect on perceived cancer risk, and one that is in some cases modified by consumers' non-genetic risk context. Our observations of modest marginal effect sizes, infrequent extreme changes in perceived risk, and a pattern of diminishing impact with time, suggest that the ability of PGT to effect changes to cancer screening and prevention behaviors may be limited by relatively small changes to perceived risk.

BACKGROUND: Body image is a critical psychosocial issue for patients with cancer because they often undergo significant changes to appearance and functioning. The primary purpose of this review article was to identify empirically-supported approaches to treat body image difficulties of adult cancer patients that can be incorporated into high-quality comprehensive cancer care. METHODS: An overview was provided of theoretical models of body image relevant to cancer patients, and findings were presented from published literature on body image and cancer from 2003 to 2013. These data were integrated with information from the patient-doctor communication literature to delineate a practical approach for assessing and treating body image concerns of adult cancer patients. RESULTS: Body image difficulties were found across patients with diverse cancer sites, and were most prevalent in the immediate postoperative and treatment period. Age, body mass index, and specific cancer treatments have been identified as potential risk factors for body image disturbance in cancer patients. Current evidence supports the use of time-limited cognitive-behavioral therapy interventions for addressing these difficulties. Other intervention strategies also show promise but require further study. Potential indicators of body image difficulties were identified to alert health care professionals when to refer patients for psychosocial care, and a framework was proposed for approaching conversations about body image that can be used by the oncologic treatment team. CONCLUSIONS: Body image issues affect a wide array of cancer patients. Providers can use available evidence combined with information from the health care communication literature to develop practical strategies for treating body image concerns of patients with cancer.

BACKGROUND: Pediatric cancers are a feature in patients with Li-Fraumeni syndrome and its variant Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome (LFS/LFL). To the best of the authors' knowledge, TP53 germline mutations are currently the only molecular defect known to be associated with this disease. Recently, a specific germline mutation in this gene, p.R337H, has been reported at a high prevalence in Brazil. METHODS: The prevalence of LFS/LFL was investigated in children with cancer who were diagnosed with tumors on the LFS/LFL spectrum and in a small consecutive series of controls without cancer. The prevalence of the germline p.R337H mutation and of other germline TP53 mutations was investigated in a general group of children with cancer and exclusively in children fulfilling the clinical criteria for LFS/LFL, respectively. RESULTS: Among the 65 children without cancer, 1.5% had a family history of LFL whereas of the 292 children with cancer, 25.3% had a family history of LFL (P < .001). Screening for the p.R337H mutation identified 11 carriers (3.7%), 9 of whom were diagnosed with adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC) and 2 of whom were diagnosed with choroid plexus carcinomas. One of the ACC probands was homozygous mutant. The Brazilian founder haplotype and loss of heterozygosity at the p.R337H locus were present in all carriers. In addition, direct sequencing of the entire TP53 coding region and gene rearrangement analysis of probands fulfilling the criteria for LFL (Eeles 2 criteria, Birch and/or Chompret criteria) and who were negative for the p.R337H mutation revealed a DNA-binding domain pathogenic mutation, p.G245S, in 1 child. CONCLUSIONS: TP53 p.R337H testing should be offered to Brazilian children diagnosed with ACC and choroid plexus carcinoma. A significant percentage of children with cancer in southern Brazil fulfill the criteria for LFL and should be referred for genetic risk assessment.

Background Registration of haematological malignancies presents specific challenges, and a wide range of data is required to ensure case ascertainment and proper classification of these diseases. We studied the data quality of myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic neoplasms in the Finnish Cancer Registry (FCR), comparing information with hospital discharges. Material and methods Hospital discharges (HILMO) in 2007-2013 including diagnostic codes of myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic neoplasms were extracted. Patients were individually linked to the FCR database for all haematological malignancies registered in 1953-2013. Coverage and accuracy of the FCR and agreement between registers was estimated. Results In total 5289 individuals were retrieved from two registers. Of these, 1406 were common, 1080 only found in the FCR and 2803 only in the HILMO. Coverage of myeloproliferative and myelodysplastic neoplasms in the FCR was 47.0% (95% CI 45.7-48.4%). Almost one quarter of the registrations in the FCR was based on a death certificate only. The accuracy of diagnosis was 51.4% (95% CI 49.4-53.3%), but it varied substantially by disease category. Kappa statistic for agreement between registers was excellent (0.83, 95% CI 0.80-0.85) for common cases. 7.6% of cases in the HILMO was registered as leukaemias in the FCR. Conclusions More than half of the patients found in the HILMO were entirely missing from the FCR. However, some of the diagnoses in HILMO may be preliminary and this represents the maximal number of missing cases. Cancer registers benefit from supplementary data sources, such as hospital discharges, to increase coverage and accuracy of register data on haematological malignancies.

BACKGROUND: Tracheal cancers (TC) are rare and treatment results that are reported are typically not satisfactory. The purpose of this research was assessment of the results of treatment of TC patients, identification of potential additional surgery candidates, evaluation of prognostic factors, and assessment of the occurrence of other malignancies. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Regional Cancer Database and the Hospital Database were searched for patients with tracheal neoplasms. Fifty-eight of 418 patients identified initially, met the inclusion criteria (primary TC with confirmed histology and complete treatment records). Standard statistical tests were used. RESULTS: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC; 63.8%) and adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC; 15.5%) were the most commonly diagnosed histological types of TC. Radiotherapy was delivered in 48 cases, surgery or endoscopic resection in 20, and chemotherapy in 14. TC was diagnosed as a second cancer in 10 patients, in 1 patient it occurred prior to the lung cancer, and in 1 was diagnosed simultaneously. During the median follow-up of 12.7 months, 85.5% of the patients died because of the disease. Local recurrence occurred in 17% cases. In univariate analysis, patients with ACC had statistically better five-year overall survival (77.8%) than those diagnosed with SCC (8.4%, p = 0.0001). Radiotherapy, performance status and haemoptysis were factors significantly influencing overall survival (OS) in the multivariate analysis. Among patients who were not treated surgically, 15-26% were found to constitute additional surgery candidates, depending on the selection criteria. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnostic workup should be focused on the identification of TC patients suitable for invasive treatment and radiotherapy. Respiratory system cancer survivors can be considered a risk group for tracheal cancer. Radiotherapy constitutes an important part of the treatment of patients with TC.

Nearly a century ago, Otto Warburg made the astute observation that the metabolic properties of cancer cells differ markedly from those of normal cells. Several decades passed before the concept of exploiting cancer cell metabolism came into clinical practice with the advent of chemotherapy, the underlying principle of which is to target rapidly dividing cells by interfering with critical processes that are all, on some level, driven by cell metabolism. Although chemotherapy can be quite effective, success rates are highly variable and the adverse effects associated with treatment often outweigh the benefits due to the fact that chemotherapy is indiscriminately cytotoxic against all rapidly dividing cells, cancerous or healthy. During the past several years, a more intricate understanding of cancer cell metabolism has permitted the development of targeted therapies that aim to specifically target cancer cells and spare healthy tissue by exploiting the altered metabolism of cancer cells. The identification of new metabolic targets and the subsequent development of small-molecule inhibitors of metabolic enzymes have demonstrated the utility and promise of targeting cancer cell metabolism as an anticancer strategy. This review summarizes recent advances in the identification and characterization of several metabolic enzymes as emerging anticancer targets.

PURPOSE: The cancer survival was characterized by following up sampled subgroups of cancer cases from three population-based cancer registries in Northeast China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Survival analysis was used to analyze 6,871 patients, who had one of the 21 most common cancers based on sampling from the population-based cancer registries of three cities in Liaoning Province. All patients were diagnosed between 2000 and 2002 and were followed up to the end of 2007 by active and passive methods. The 5-year age standardized relative survival rates (ASRS) were estimated for all cancers combined and each of the 21 individual cancers. RESULTS: The survival status was traced for 80.8% of 8,506 sampled cancer cases. The 5-year ASRS for all 21 cancers combined was 41.5% (95% confidence interval, 40.3 to 42.7), the highest ASRS was observed for thyroid cancer (85.2%), breast cancer (78.9%), uterine corpus cancer (75.9%), and urinary bladder cancer (70.2%); the lowest 5-year ASRS was noted in pancreatic cancer (8.8%), liver cancer (11.0%), esophageal cancer (18.8), and lung cancer (19.6%). The cancer survival rates in Liaoning cities were similar to those of urban areas in mainland China, but significantly lower than those in Hong Kong, Korea, and Japan. CONCLUSION: The strikingly poor cancer survival rates in three cities of Liaoning Province and in other places in China highlight the need for urgent investment in cancer prevention, early detection, and standardized and centralized treatment.

PURPOSE: To assess the validity of the cohort study participants' self-reported cancer history via data linkage to a cancer registry database. METHODS: We included 143,965 participants from the Health Examinees (HEXA) study recruited between 2004 and 2013 who gave informed consent for record linkage to the Korean Central Cancer Registry (KCCR). The sensitivity and the positive predictive value of self-reported histories of cancer were calculated and 95% confidence intervals were estimated. RESULTS: A total of 4,860 participants who had at least one record in the KCCR were included in the calculation of sensitivity. In addition, 3,671 participants who reported a cancer history at enrollment were included in the calculation of positive predictive value. The overall sensitivity of self-reported cancer history was 72.0%. Breast cancer history among women showed the highest sensitivity (81.2%), whereas the lowest sensitivity was observed for liver cancer (53.7%) and cervical cancer (52.1%). The overall positive predictive value was 81.9%. The highest positive predictive value was observed for thyroid cancer (96.1%) and prostate cancer (96.1%), and the lowest was observed for cervical cancer (43.7%). CONCLUSION: The accuracy of self-reported cancer history varied by cancer site and may not be sufficient to ascertain cancer incidence, especially for cervical and bladder cancers.

BACKGROUND: Cancer-related fatigue is a common problem in persons with cancer, influencing health-related quality of life and causing a considerable challenge to society. Current evidence supports the beneficial effects of physical exercise in reducing fatigue, but the results across studies are not consistent, especially in terms of exercise intensity. It is also unclear whether use of behaviour change techniques can further increase exercise adherence and maintain physical activity behaviour. This study will investigate whether exercise intensity affects fatigue and health related quality of life in persons undergoing adjuvant cancer treatment. In addition, to examine effects of exercise intensity on mood disturbance, adherence to oncological treatment, adverse effects from treatment, activities of daily living after treatment completion and return to work, and behaviour change techniques effect on exercise adherence. We will also investigate whether exercise intensity influences inflammatory markers and cytokines, and whether gene expressions following training serve as mediators for the effects of exercise on fatigue and health related quality of life. METHODS/DESIGN: Six hundred newly diagnosed persons with breast, colorectal or prostate cancer undergoing adjuvant therapy will be randomized in a 2 x 2 factorial design to following conditions; A) individually tailored low-to-moderate intensity exercise with or without behaviour change techniques or B) individually tailored high intensity exercise with or without behaviour change techniques. The training consists of both resistance and endurance exercise sessions under the guidance of trained coaches. The primary outcomes, fatigue and health related quality of life, are measured by self-reports. Secondary outcomes include fitness, mood disturbance, adherence to the cancer treatment, adverse effects, return to activities of daily living after completed treatment, return to work as well as inflammatory markers, cytokines and gene expression. DISCUSSION: The study will contribute to our understanding of the value of exercise and exercise intensity in reducing fatigue and improving health related quality of life and, potentially, clinical outcomes. The value of behaviour change techniques in terms of adherence to and maintenance of physical exercise behaviour in persons with cancer will be evaluated. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02473003 , October, 2014.

Iron is an essential nutrient that facilitates cell proliferation and growth. Iron can be detrimental, however. The ability of iron to cycle between oxidized and reduced forms contributes to the formation of free radicals. An excess of free radicals leads to lipid peroxidation, more reactive oxygen species and oxidative stress, damage to DNA and other biomolecules, and, if potentially, tumorigenesis. Iron also has a role in the maintenance of the tumor microenvironment and in metastasis. Pathways of iron acquisition, efflux, storage, and regulation are all perturbed in cancer, suggesting that reprogramming of iron metabolism is a central aspect of tumor cell survival. Recent studies have shed light on the role of iron metabolism in cancer stem cells (CSC) and suggest that specific targeting of iron metabolism in CSCs may improve the efficacy of cancer therapy. In this review, we first summarize briefly our current understanding of the intracellular processes involving iron, the effect of dietary iron, and its relation to cancer. We emphasize the importance of modifier "iron genes" in cancer and the possibility that these genes may encode biomarkers that may be used clinically. We then provide an update on the role of iron in metabolic reprogramming, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the regulation of epigenetic marks essential for CSC maintenance and plasticity. Finally, we discuss the potential of targeting a recently discovered form of iron-regulated cell death, ferroptosis, in CSCs for treatment of cancer.

Non-invasive diagnosis of cancer is often the key to effective treatment and patient survival. Saliva as a multi-constituent oral fluid comprises various disease signaling biomarkers, holds great potential for early-stage cancer diagnostics with cost-effective and easy collection, storage, transport and processing. Therefore, detection of biomarkers and proteins in the saliva samples is highly demand. The current review was performed using reliable internet database (mainly PubMed) to provide an overview of the most recent developments on non-invasive diagnosis of cancers in saliva and highlights main challenges and future prospects in sensing of the salivary biomarkers. The conventional detection methods of cancer biomarkers in saliva is discussed in the paper, however, the main focus is on non-invasive diagnosis of cancers in saliva using immunosensing (electrochemical, optical, piezoelectric), DNA based sensors, aptasensors and peptide based bio-assays The reviewed literature revealed that non-invasive cancer detection methods using the mentioned biosensors and without any processing of saliva sample offers a quick, sensitive, specific and cost effective analytical tool. Besides, salivary based detection methods can be used for simultaneous detection of panels of disease specific biomarkers in a real time manner or as home testing kits in near future.

Cancer-testis antigens (CTAs) are considered as unique and promising cancer biomarkers and targets for cancer therapy. CTAs are multifunctional protein group with specific expression patterns in normal embryonic and adult cells and various types of cancer cells. CTAs are involved in regulating of the basic cellular processes during development, stem cell differentiation and carcinogenesis though the biological roles and cell functions of CTA families remain largely unclear. Analysis of CTA expression patterns in embryonic germ and somatic cells, pluripotent and multipotent stem cells, cancer stem cells and their cell descendants indicates that rearrangements of characteristic CTA profiles (aberrant expression) could be associated with cancer transformation and failure of the developmental program of cell lineage specification and germ line restriction. Therefore, aberrant CTA profiles can be used as panels of biomarkers for diagnoses and the selection of cancer treatment strategies. Moreover, immunogenic CTAs are prospective targets for cancer immunotherapy. Clinical trials testing broad range of cancer therapeutic vaccines against antigens of MAGEA and NY-ESO-1 families for treating various cancers have shown mixed clinical efficiency, safety and tolerability, suggesting the requirement of in-depth research of CTA expression in normal and cancer stem cells and extensive clinical trials for improving cancer immunotherapy technologies. This review focuses on recent advancement in study of CTAs in normal and cancer cells, particularly in normal and cancer stem cells, and provides a new insight into CTA expression patterns during normal and cancer stem cell lineage development. Additionally, new approaches in development of effective CTA-based therapies exclusively targeting cancer stem cells will be discussed.

BACKGROUNDS: Multidisciplinary therapy has increased the risk of subsequent late effects, but detailed analyses on secondary cancers in childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) are limited in Asian countries. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study comprising 10,069 CCSs who were diagnosed between 1980 and 2009 across 15 Japanese hospitals. We conducted secondary analyses to estimate the incidence of secondary cancer according to each primary malignancy and to elucidate the association between primary and secondary cancers. We also explored the risk factors for the development of secondary cancer in each independent primary malignancy. RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of secondary cancer at 20 years varied among primary cancers: hematological malignancy, 3.1% (95% CI 2.2-4.3); retinoblastoma, 6.6% (95% CI 1.5-16.8); pediatric solid tumor, 2.5% (95% CI 1.3-4.2); brain tumors, 5.2% (95% CI 1.7-11.8) bone/soft tissue sarcoma, 5.2% (95% CI 2.3-10.1); and others, 3.3% (95% CI 1.6-6.0) (p = 0.015). The cumulative incidence of secondary cancers is highest in those with osteosarcoma (13.1%) followed by those with hepatoblastoma (8.4%) and retinoblastoma (6.6%). Close association between the primary and secondary cancer diagnoses was found. The risk factors for secondary cancer development depended on the primary cancer, but autologous/allogeneic stem cell transplantation was a relatively common risk factor. CONCLUSION: The cumulative incidence of secondary cancer varied among primary cancers. The primary cancer was closely associated with the secondary cancer but stem cell transplantation was a common risk factor for secondary cancers among CCSs.

AIM: Cancer and chronic kidney disease are known to be associated. The way in which a history of cancer can influence outcome in dialysis is not well described. This work aimed to evaluate survival of cancer patients starting chronic dialysis after their diagnosis of cancer. METHODS: We merged data from cancer registries and a dialysis registry, and explored patients' charts. RESULTS: Between January 2001 and December 2008, 74 patients with incident cancer in the two-counties-study-area (Calvados and Manche) started chronic dialysis after their diagnosis of cancer. Survival of these incident dialysis patients with a previous diagnosis of cancer was respectively 80.9% (confidence interval 69.9; 88.2) and 68.3% (confidence interval 56.3%; 77.7%) at 1 and 2 years. Only 29 of the 74 patients (39.2%) were still alive at the end of the observation period; median participation time was 2.8 years (1(st) and 3(rd) quartiles: 1.3-4.4). Survival of patients with cancer was not different to that of non-cancer dialysis patients matched for age and sex, except in patients with haematological malignancies who had a poorer outcome. In a multivariate stratified Cox model, the history of cancer before dialysis start was not associated with death, after adjustment on diabetes. CONCLUSION: In our study, survival in dialysis was not different among patients with a history of cancer compared to matched patients without malignancy. We can hypothesize that only some selected patients with cancer have access to dialysis. Studies in ESRD patients with cancer should be performed to evaluate access to dialysis in that population.

A significant reduction in lung cancer specific mortality rate was demonstrated by the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) in participants who had annual low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening. In addition to early detection of lung cancer, lung cancer screening (LCS) provides an opportunity to detect cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and interstitial lung disease), and extrapulmonary neoplasms, such as thyroid, breast, kidney, liver, esophageal, pancreatic and mediastinal tumors. Considering the fact that 22.3% of the certified deaths in the computed tomography (CT) arm of the NLST trial were due to extrapulmonary malignancies, compared to 22.9% of deaths from lung cancer, it is possible that early diagnosis and treatment of clinically significant incidental findings may further decrease morbidity and mortality in screening participants. In this article we review prevalence, clinical relevance and management of incidentally detected extrapulmonary malignancies.

BACKGROUND: The cost of cancer and outcomes of cancer care have been discussed a lot since cancer represents 3-6% of total healthcare costs and cost estimations have indicated growing costs. There are studies considering the cost of all cancers, but studies focusing on the cost of disease and outcomes in most common cancer sites are limited. The objective of this study was to analyze the development of the costs and outcomes in Finland between 2009 and 2014 per cancer site. METHODS: The National cost, episode and outcomes data were obtained from the National register databases based on International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnosis codes. Cost data included both the direct and indirect costs. Two hospitals were used to validate the costs of care. The outcome measures included relative survival rate, mortality, sick leave days per patient and number of new disability pensions. FINDINGS: The outcomes of cancer care in most common cancer sites have improved in Finland between 2009-2014. The real costs per new cancer patient decreased in seven out of ten most common cancer sites. The significance of different cost components differ significantly between the different cancer sites. The share of medication costs of the total cost of all cancers increased, but decreased for the five most common cancer sites. INTERPRETATION: The changes in the cost components indicate that the length of stay has shortened in special care and treatment methods have developed towards outpatient care. This partially explains the decrease of costs. Also, at the same time outcomes improved, which indicates that decrease in costs did not come at the expense of treatment quality. As the survival rates increase, the relevance of mortality measures decreases and the relevance of other, patient-relevant outcome measures increases. In the future, the outcomes and costs of health care systems should be assessed routinely for the most common patient groups.

BACKGROUND: Five highly specific physical signs associated with death within 3 days among cancer patients were recently reported that may aid in the diagnosis of impending death. In this study, the frequency and onset of another 52 bedside physical signs and their diagnostic performance for impending death were examined. METHODS: Three hundred fifty-seven consecutive patients with advanced cancer who had been admitted to acute palliative care units at 2 tertiary care cancer centers were enrolled. Fifty-two physical signs were systematically documented every 12 hours from admission to death or discharge. The frequency and median time of onset of each sign from death backwards were examined, and the likelihood ratios (LRs) associated with death within 3 days were calculated. RESULTS: Two hundred three of the 357 patients (57%) died at the end of the admission. Eight physical signs that were highly diagnostic of impending death were identified. These signs occurred in 5% to 78% of the patients within the last 3 days of life, had a late onset, and had a high specificity (>95%) and a high positive LR for death within 3 days. They included nonreactive pupils (positive LR, 16.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 14.9-18.6), a decreased response to verbal stimuli (positive LR, 8.3; 95% CI, 7.7-9), a decreased response to visual stimuli (positive LR, 6.7; 95% CI, 6.3-7.1), an inability to close eyelids (positive LR, 13.6; 95% CI, 11.7-15.5), drooping of the nasolabial fold (positive LR, 8.3; 95% CI, 7.7-8.9), hyperextension of the neck (positive LR, 7.3; 95% CI, 6.7-8), grunting of vocal cords (positive LR, 11.8; 95% CI, 10.3-13.4), and upper gastrointestinal bleeding (positive LR, 10.3; 95% CI, 9.5-11.1). CONCLUSIONS: Eight highly specific physical signs associated with death within 3 days among cancer patients were identified. These signs may inform the diagnosis of impending death.

It is now well supported that 20% of human cancers have an infectious causation (i.e., oncogenic agents). Accumulating evidence suggests that aside from this direct role, other infectious agents may also indirectly affect cancer epidemiology through interactions with the oncogenic agents within the wider infection community. Here, we address this hypothesis via analysis of large-scale global data to identify associations between human cancer incidence and assemblages of neglected infectious agents. We focus on a gradient of three widely-distributed cancers with an infectious cause: bladder (~2% of recorded cancer cases are due to Shistosoma haematobium), liver (~60% consecutive to Hepatitis B and C infection) and stomach (Helicobacter pylori is associated with ~70% of cases). We analyzed countries in tropical and temperate regions separately, and controlled for many confounding social and economic variables. First, we found that particular assemblages of bacteria are associated with bladder cancer incidences. Second, we observed a specific and robust association between helminths and liver cancer incidences in both biomes. Third, we show that certain assemblages of viruses may facilitate stomach cancer in tropical area, while others protect against its development in temperate countries. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in terms of cancer prevention and highlight the necessity to consider neglected diseases, especially in tropics, to adapt public health strategies against infectious diseases and cancer.

Gene expression (GE) studies have been playing a critical role in cancer research. Despite tremendous effort, the analysis results are still often unsatisfactory, because of the weak signals and high data dimensionality. Analysis is often further challenged by the long-tailed distributions of the outcome variables. In recent multidimensional studies, data have been collected on GEs as well as their regulators (e.g., copy number alterations (CNAs), methylation, and microRNAs), which can provide additional information on the associations between GEs and cancer outcomes. In this study, we develop an ARMI (assisted robust marker identification) approach for analyzing cancer studies with measurements on GEs as well as regulators. The proposed approach borrows information from regulators and can be more effective than analyzing GE data alone. A robust objective function is adopted to accommodate long-tailed distributions. Marker identification is effectively realized using penalization. The proposed approach has an intuitive formulation and is computationally much affordable. Simulation shows its satisfactory performance under a variety of settings. TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data on melanoma and lung cancer are analyzed, which leads to biologically plausible marker identification and superior prediction.

BACKGROUND: Compromised physical fitness and cognitive difficulties have been reported as late effects of cancer treatment during childhood. To assess this issue, the military rankings of cancer survivors in medical checkups at call-up, and conscripts' physical and cognitive performance during the first weeks of compulsory military education were compared to those of matched population controls without a history of cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 1680 male patients born between 1960 and 1992 with a malignancy diagnosed before the age of 16 who were alive at the call-up age (18 years) were identified using the Finnish Cancer Registry, and five age, sex and place of residence matched controls for each patient using the Population Register Centre. Data on military service were gathered from Finnish Defense Forces. A conditional logistic regression analysis, the GEE-method with the cumulative logit link function, the chi-square test, the chi-square test for trend and a one-way analysis of variance were used in different analyses. RESULTS: Cancer survivors were exempted from military service more often than the controls (p < .001). The fit-for-service frequency was highest for survivors of kidney tumors (68%) and lowest after irradiated brain tumors (19%). In service, the results of the 12-min running test were poorer than those of controls for leukemia/non-Hodgkin lymphoma (p = .03) and brain tumor (p = .01) survivors. Interestingly, the standing long-jump test was the only muscle test for which survivor groups performed worse than controls. Performance on cognitive tests only differed from controls in brain tumor survivors. CONCLUSIONS: Exemption from service is still common under the current guidelines, but fit-for-service survivors do well in military education. These results can be used for reassuring survivors that completion of military service is possible for those fulfilling the national general guidelines for military fitness.

Various infectious agents are classical risk factors for cancer including bacteria, viruses and parasites. There is less evidence concerning the implication of fungal infection in carcinogenesis. The role of chronic Candida infection in the development of squamous cell carcinoma has been suspected for years. Candida sp are more prevalent in potentially malignant disorder and cancer of the oral mucosa. Other epidemiological evidence of a link between Candida infection and cancer is what is observed in patients with Autoimmune Polyendocrinopathy Candidiasis Ectodermal Dystrophy (APECED). Oral and oesophagal carcinoma are frequent in these patients with chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Production of nitrosamine and metabolism of procarcinogen are mecanisms in which Candida sp may be involved in oral cancer development. In chromomycosis and lobomycosis chronic lesions may have a risk of malignant transformation. A diagnosis of paracoccidioidomycosis appears to increase the risk of lung cancer.

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) identified using tumor gene expression data could affect gene expression in cancer cells, tumor-associated normal cells, or both. Here, we have demonstrated a method to identify eQTLs affecting expression in cancer cells by modeling the statistical interaction between genotype and tumor purity. Only one third of breast cancer risk variants, identified as eQTLs from a conventional analysis, could be confidently attributed to cancer cells. The remaining variants could affect cells of the tumor microenvironment, such as immune cells and fibroblasts. Deconvolution of tumor eQTLs will help determine how inherited polymorphisms influence cancer risk, development, and treatment response.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survivors use complementary therapies (CTs) for a variety of reasons; however, with interest and use reportedly on the rise and a widening range of products and practices available, there is a need to establish trends in and drivers of interest. We aimed to determine (1) frequencies of use, level of interest, and barriers for 30 specific CTs and (2) whether physical symptoms, perceived stress (PS), or spiritual well-being were related to interest levels. METHOD: A total of 212 cancer outpatients were surveyed at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary, Canada. RESULTS: Overall, up to 75% of survivors already used some form of CTs since their diagnosis. The most highly used were the following: vitamins B12 and D, multivitamins, calcium, and breathing and relaxation exercises. Those who had not used CTs indicated highest interest in massage, vitamin B12, breathing and relaxation, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and antioxidants. The most frequently reported barriers for all CTs were not knowing enough about what a therapy was and not having enough evidence on whether it worked. High PS predicted higher interest for all CTs, but spirituality was not significantly related to any. Physical symptoms, anxiety, and depression were significant predictors of interest for some CTs. CONCLUSION: These findings provide a blueprint for future clinical efficacy trials and highlight the need for clinical practice guidelines.

OBJECTIVE: To identify the trends in incidence of serous fallopian tube, ovarian, and peritoneal epithelial cancers in the United States. METHODS: Data was obtained from United States Cancer Statistics (USCS) from 2001 to 2014. All incidences are per 100,000 women. Analyses were performed using SEER*Stat and Joinpoint regression programs. RESULTS: Of the 146,470 patients with serous cancers, 9381 (6.4%) were fallopian tube, 121,418 (82.9%) were ovarian, and 15,671 (10.7%) were primary peritoneal. The study period was divided from 2001 to 2005, 2006-2010, and 2011-2014, and there was an increase in fallopian tube incidence from 0.19 to 0.35 to 0.63, with a corresponding decrease in ovarian incidence from 5.31 to 5.08 to 4.86. There was no significant change in peritoneal cancers from 0.64 to 0.69 to 0.62. The age-specific peak incidence of fallopian tube cancer was younger at age 70-74, compared to ovarian and peritoneal cancer at age 75-79. Further, the incidence of serous fallopian tube cancer was highest in Whites at 0.42, compared to Blacks at 0.24, Hispanics at 0.27, and Asians at 0.28. CONCLUSION: From 2001 to 2014, the diagnosis of serous fallopian tube cancer increased fourfold with a corresponding decrease in ovarian cancer. The peak incidence of tubal cancer was 70-74years with an increased incidence in Whites.

PURPOSE: The study was aimed to describe the characteristics of cancer patients admitted to the oncological ICU and to identify clinical features associated with outcomes. METHODS: This is a prospective study (January 2014 to December 2015) of 522 cancer patients consecutively admitted to the oncological ICU. Patients with a length of oncological ICU stay </= 1 day were excluded. Demographic and clinical variables were obtained at oncological ICU admission. The primary outcome of interest was hospital mortality. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for hospital mortality. RESULTS: The study cohort consisted of 492 (94.3%) patients with solid tumours and 30 patients (5.7%) with haematological malignancies. Advanced cancer was observed in 53.3%. Unplanned admission accounted for 25.3%. Hospital mortality rate was 13.0% (n = 68), and it was higher for patients with unplanned admission than those for electively admitted patients (35.6% vs. 5.4; p < 0.0001). Stage IV of cancer (OR 5.28; 95% CI 2.71-10.28; p < 0.0001), patients from the emergency department (OR 3.33; 95% CI 1.68-6.61; p = 0.001), unplanned admission (OR 7.99; 95% CI 4.45-14.33; p < 0.0001), non-malignancy-related admission (OR 5.80; 95% CI 3.26-10.32; p < 0.0001), sepsis (OR 4.81; 95% CI 2.28-10.16; p < 0.0001), chemotherapy-induced adverse event (OR 5.64; 95% CI 2.33-13.66; p < 0.0001), and invasive mechanical ventilation (OR 18.70; 95% CI 9.93-35.21; p < 0.0001) were independently associated with increased hospital mortality in multivariate logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: ICU admission of cancer patients should be based on potential chance of recovering from the acute problem. Clinical predictor for mortality could support this purpose (UIN: researchregistry3484).

PURPOSE: We have limited capability to predict survival among patients treated for metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Further research is warranted to identify significant prognostic and predictive factors. METHODS: We identified all HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab at the Sunnybrook Odette Cancer Centre (SOCC) from 1999 to 2013 through the Cancer Care Ontario (CCO) Registry (n = 256) and selected patients with available pathology reports (n = 154). A retrospective review was completed documenting clinical, pathologic, and laboratory characteristics at the time of first trastuzumab therapy and survival outcomes. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to identify prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) (primary endpoint) and failure-free survival (FFS), adjusted for the known prognostic factors of the presence of CNS metastases and the presence of >/= 2 distant metastatic sites. RESULTS: A multivariable model identified older age [hazard ratio (HR) 1.18/decade, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-1.37)], increased platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) (HR 1.75/log-unit, 95% CI 1.25-2.46), increased serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (HR 1.87/log-unit, 95% CI 1.41-2.49), and ER positivity (HR 0.63, 95% CI 0.42-0.96) as significant prognostic factors for OS after adjusting for the presence of CNS metastasis (HR 3.19, 95% CI 1.59-6.38) and the presence of >/= 2 distant metastatic sites (HR 2.10, 95% CI 1.19-3.70). PLR (HR 1.54/log-unit, 95% CI 1.12-2.12) was the only prognostic factor associated with FFS after adjusting for CNS and >/= 2 distant metastatic sites. CONCLUSION: Older age, increased PLR, and ALP were identified as poor prognostic factors and ER positivity as a favorable prognostic factor for OS after adjusting for the presence of CNS metastasis and the presence of number of >/= 2 distant metastatic sites. Increased PLR was a poor prognostic factor for both OS and FFS, and warrants further investigation into its prognostic ability amongst patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.

For a decade, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program collected clinicopathologic annotation data along with multi-platform molecular profiles of more than 11,000 human tumors across 33 different cancer types. TCGA clinical data contain key features representing the democratized nature of the data collection process. To ensure proper use of this large clinical dataset associated with genomic features, we developed a standardized dataset named the TCGA Pan-Cancer Clinical Data Resource (TCGA-CDR), which includes four major clinical outcome endpoints. In addition to detailing major challenges and statistical limitations encountered during the effort of integrating the acquired clinical data, we present a summary that includes endpoint usage recommendations for each cancer type. These TCGA-CDR findings appear to be consistent with cancer genomics studies independent of the TCGA effort and provide opportunities for investigating cancer biology using clinical correlates at an unprecedented scale.

BACKGROUND: Cancer survival has persistently been shown to be worse for Eastern European and UK/Ireland patients than those of other European regions. This is often attributed to later stage at diagnosis. However, few stage-specific survival comparisons are available, so it is unclear whether poorer quality treatment or other factors also contribute. For the first time, European cancer registries have provided stage-at-diagnosis data to EUROCARE, enabling population-based stage-specific survival estimates across Europe. DATA AND METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, stage at diagnosis (as TNM, condensed TNM, or Extent of Disease) was analysed for patients (>/=15 years) from 15 countries grouped into 4 regions (Northern Europe: Norway; Central Europe: Austria, France, Germany, Switzerland, The Netherlands; Southern Europe: Croatia, Italy, Slovenia, and Spain; and Eastern Europe: Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, and Slovakia), diagnosed with 7 malignant cancers in 2000-2007, and followed to end of 2008. A new variable (reconstructed stage) was created which used all available stage information. Age-standardised 5-year relative survival (RS) by reconstructed stage was estimated and compared between regions. Excess risks of cancer death in the 5 years after diagnosis were also estimated, taking age, sex and stage into account. RESULTS: Low proportions of Eastern European patients were diagnosed with local stage cancers and high proportions with metastatic stage cancers. Stage-specific RS (especially for non-metastatic disease) was generally lower for Eastern European patients. After adjusting for age, sex, and stage, excess risks of death remained higher for Eastern European patients than for European patients in general. CONCLUSIONS: Late diagnosis alone does not explain worse cancer survival in Eastern Europe: greater risk of cancer death together with worse stage-specific survival suggest less effective care, probably in part because fewer resources are allocated to health care than in the rest of Europe. We recommend that Eastern European cancer registries and other involved bodies to draw attention to poor cancer survival, so as to stimulate research and inform policies to improve outcomes.

BACKGROUND: Adult survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for suicide ideation, although longitudinal patterns and rates of recurrent suicide ideation are unknown. This study investigated the prevalence of late report (ie, after initial assessment) and recurrent suicide ideation in adult survivors of childhood cancer, identified predictors of suicide ideation, and examined associations among suicide ideation and mortality. METHODS: Participants included 9128 adult survivors of childhood cancer and 3082 sibling controls enrolled in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study who completed a survey question assessing suicide ideation on one or more occasions between 1994 and 2010. Suicide ideation was assessed using the Brief Symptom Inventory-18 instrument. Mortality data was ascertained from the National Death Index. RESULTS: Survivors were more likely to report late (odds ratio [OR] =1.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.5-2.5) and recurrent suicide ideation (OR=2.6, 95% CI=1.8-3.8) compared to siblings. Poor physical health status was associated with increased risk of suicide ideation in survivors (late report: OR=1.9, 95% CI=1.3-2.7; recurrent: OR=1.9, 95% CI=1.2-2.9). Suicide ideation was associated with increased risk for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio=1.3, 95% CI=1.03-1.6) and death by external causes (hazard ratio=2.4, 95% CI=1.4-4.1). CONCLUSIONS: Adult survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for late-report and recurrent suicide ideation, which is associated with increased risk of mortality. Routine screening for psychological distress in adult survivors appears warranted, especially for survivors who develop chronic physical health conditions.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patients in the MA.27 trial had similar outcomes with steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) exemestane and nonsteroidal anastrozole. AIs increase the risk of osteoporosis. This study examined the effects of self-reported osteoporosis and osteoporosis therapy (OPT) on outcomes. METHODS: The MA.27 phase 3 adjuvant trial enrolled 7576 postmenopausal women. The primary outcome was event-free survival (EFS), and the secondary outcome was distant disease-free survival (DDFS). Patients were permitted bisphosphonates to prevent or treat osteopenia/osteoporosis. In a multivariate, stratified Cox regression, factors were significant with a 2-sided Wald test P value </= .05. RESULTS: Osteoporosis was reported at the baseline by 654 of the 7576 women (8.6%) and in total by 1294 patients. Oral OPT was received at the baseline by 815 of the 7576 women (10.8%) and in total by 2711 patients (36%). With a median follow-up of 4.1 years, 693 EFS events (9.15%) and 321 DDFS events (4.2%) occurred. Osteoporosis was not associated with EFS or DDFS. Few EFS events occurred before the initiation of OPT, with no substantive evidence of a time-differing effect on outcomes (nonproportional hazards). OPT (yes vs no) was significantly associated with improved EFS (hazard ratio [HR] for yes vs no, 0.67; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.57-0.80; P < .001) and DDFS (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.44-0.73; P <. 001). Time-differing (time-dependent) OPT was not (EFS; P = .45). OPT did not alter the incidence of visceral-only metastasis (P = .31). CONCLUSIONS: Oral OPT, administered to postmenopausal breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant AI therapy, was associated with improved EFS and DDFS; the time of OPT initiation (a time-dependent effect) did not affect the outcome. OPT did not alter the risk of visceral metastasis. Cancer 2017;123:2444-51. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: When individuals stop working due to cancer this represents a loss to society - the loss of productivity. The aim of this analysis was to estimate productivity losses associated with premature mortality from all adult cancers and from the 20 highest mortality adult cancers in Ireland in 2011, and project these losses until 2030. METHODS: An incidence-based method was used to estimate the cost of cancer deaths between 2011 and 2030 using the Human Capital Approach. National data were used for cancer, population and economic inputs. Both paid work and unpaid household activities were included. Sensitivity analyses estimated the impact of assumptions around future cancer mortality rates, retirement ages, value of unpaid work, wage growth and discounting. RESULTS: The 233,000 projected deaths from all invasive cancers in Ireland between 2011 and 2030 will result in lost productivity valued at euro73 billion; euro13 billion in paid work and euro60 billion in household activities. These losses represent approximately 1.4 % of Ireland's GDP annually. The most costly cancers are lung (euro14.4 billion), colorectal and breast cancer (euro8.3 billion each). However, when viewed as productivity losses per cancer death, testis (euro364,000 per death), cervix (euro155,000 per death) and brain cancer (euro136,000 per death) are most costly because they affect working age individuals. An annual 1 % reduction in mortality reduces productivity losses due to all invasive cancers by euro8.5 billion over 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: Society incurs substantial losses in productivity as a result of cancer-related mortality, particularly when household production is included. These estimates provide valuable evidence to inform resource allocation decisions in cancer prevention and control.

BACKGROUND: The chronicity status of breast cancer survivors suggests a growing need for cancer rehabilitation. Currently, the use of technology is a promising strategy for providing support, as reflected in the emergence of research interest in Web-based interventions in cancer survivorship. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted that included a total of 81 participants who had completed adjuvant therapy (except hormone treatment) for stage I to IIIA breast cancer. Participants were randomly assigned to an 8-week Internet-based, tailored exercise program (n = 40) or to a control group (n = 41).The instruments used at baseline, 8 weeks, and 6-month follow-up were the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30 and its breast cancer module, the Brief Pain Inventory, the handgrip dynamometer, the isometric abdominal test, the back dynamometer, the multiple sit-to-stand test, and the Piper Fatigue Scale. RESULTS: After the intervention, the telerehabilitation group had significantly improved scores for global health status, physical, role, cognitive functioning, and arm symptoms (all P < .01) as well as pain severity (P = .001) and pain interference (P = .045) compared with the control group. Significant improvements also were observed favoring the telerehabilitation group for affected and nonaffected side handgrip (both P = .006), abdominal, back and lower body strength (all P < .01), and total fatigue (P < .001). These findings were maintained after 6 months of follow-up, except for role functioning, pain severity, and nonaffected side handgrip. Analysis was based on an intention-to-treat principle. CONCLUSIONS: This program may improve adverse effects and maintain benefits in breast cancer survivors. The results of this study have encouraging implications for cancer care.

Despite decades of research and an enormity of resultant data, cancer remains a significant public health problem. New tools and fresh perspectives are needed to obtain fundamental insights, to develop better prognostic and predictive tools, and to identify improved therapeutic interventions. With increasingly common genome-scale data, one suite of algorithms and concepts with potential to shed light on cancer biology is phylogenetics, a scientific discipline used in diverse fields. From grouping subsets of cancer samples to tracing subclonal evolution during cancer progression and metastasis, the use of phylogenetics is a powerful systems biology approach. Well-developed phylogenetic applications provide fast, robust approaches to analyze high-dimensional, heterogeneous cancer data sets. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Evolutionary principles - heterogeneity in cancer?, edited by Dr. Robert A. Gatenby.

BACKGROUND: The single-payer universal health care system in Ontario, Canada creates a setting with reduced socioeconomic barriers to treatment. Herein, the authors sought to elucidate the influence of sociodemographic marginalization on receipt of pancreatectomy, overall survival (OS), and receipt of adjuvant treatment among patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer at the population level using an observational cohort study design. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in Ontario between January 2005 and January 2010 were identified using the provincial cancer registry and linked to administrative databases. Census data obtained from each patient's postal code were used as a proxy for that patient's median income, residential instability, material deprivation, ethnic concentration, and dependency (percentage aged <15 years, aged >65 years, and unemployed). Surgical specimen pathology reports were abstracted for histopathology and margin status. Independent predictors of undergoing pancreatectomy, OS after surgical resection, and receipt of adjuvant treatment were identified by logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards analysis. RESULTS: Of the 6296 patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, 820 (13%) underwent resection of their tumor. Increasing levels of residential instability (odds ratio [OR], 0.86; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.80-0.94) and material deprivation (OR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.79-0.94) predicted a decreased likelihood of undergoing surgical resection. Patients living in rural areas (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.51-0.91) and those living in urban areas with lower incomes (OR range, 0.49-0.77) were found to have a lower likelihood of undergoing surgical resection compared with patients in the urban areas with the highest income. After surgical resection, an association between sociodemographic marginalization with OS or receipt of adjuvant treatment was not identified. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic marginalization exerts its influence early in the pancreatic cancer care continuum, and appears to be associated more with which patients undergo surgical resection than the receipt of adjuvant treatment.

Patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, including essential thrombocythemia (ET), polycythemia vera (PV), and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), are at increased risk of new hematologic malignancies, but their risk of nonhematologic malignancies remains unknown. In the present study, we assessed the risk of both types of malignancies after an ET, PV, or CML diagnosis. We linked 2 population-based nationwide registries, the Danish National Registry of Patients, covering all Danish hospitals and the Danish Cancer Registry, and assessed subsequent cancer risk in a cohort of all 7229 patients diagnosed with a chronic myeloproliferative neoplasm during 1977-2008. We compared the incidence of subsequent cancer in this cohort with that expected on the basis of cancer incidence in the general population (standardized incidence ratio). Overall, ET, PV, and CML patients were at increased risk of developing both new hematologic and nonhematologic cancers. The standardized incidence ratio for developing a nonhematologic cancer was 1.2 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]): 1.0-1.4) for patients with ET, 1.4 (95% CI: 1.3-1.5) for patients with PV, and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.3-2.0) for patients with CML. We conclude that patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms are at increased risk of developing a new malignant disease.

PURPOSE: Acromegaly is a chronic disease resulting from pathological oversecretion of growth hormone and subsequently insulin growth factor-1. Several complications of the disease have been reported, including cardiovascular diseases, respiratory disorders but also increased risk of benign and malignant neoplasms. The aim of the study was to evaluate the risk of malignant neoplasms in the patients with acromegaly in comparison with the control group. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Medical documentation of acromegalic patients treated in one medical center between 2005 and 2016 has been analyzed. Results were compared with sex- and age-matched group of subjects with prolactinomas and hormonally inactive pituitary lesions hospitalized in the same department. RESULTS: Two hundred patients with acromegaly were included. Control group was composed of 145 patients. Any malignant neoplasm in anamnesis was present in 27 (13.5 %) patients with acromegaly and six (4.1 %) subjects from control group (p = 0.003). Thyroid cancer was present in 14 (7.0 %) patients with acromegaly and two (1.4 %) in control group (p = 0.02). Breast cancer was present in seven women (5.4 % of women) in acromegaly group but none of subjects in control group (p = 0.02). Colon cancer-4 (2.0 %) patients in acromegaly group and 0 in control group (p = 0.14). CONCLUSIONS: Malignant neoplasms are significantly more common in patients with acromegaly. Particularly, risk of thyroid cancer was increased over fivefold. Systematic screening for neoplastic diseases should be important part of follow-up in these patients. Further case-control studies are strongly indicated to evaluate which neoplasms are more common in acromegalic patients and what is the exact risk of malignancy.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are increasingly recognized as critical determinants of cellular signaling and a strict balance of ROS levels must be maintained to ensure proper cellular function and survival. Notably, ROS is increased in cancer cells. The superoxide dismutase family plays an essential physiological role in mitigating deleterious effects of ROS. Due to the compartmentalization of ROS signaling, EcSOD, the only superoxide dismutase in the extracellular space, has unique characteristics and functions in cellular signal transduction. In comparison to the other two intracellular SODs, EcSOD is a relatively new comer in terms of its tumor suppressive role in cancer and the mechanisms involved are less well understood. Nevertheless, the degree of differential expression of this extracellular antioxidant in cancer versus normal cells/tissues is more pronounced and prevalent than the other SODs. A significant association of low EcSOD expression with reduced cancer patient survival further suggests that loss of extracellular redox regulation promotes a conducive microenvironment that favors cancer progression. The vast array of mechanisms reported in mediating deregulation of EcSOD expression, function, and cellular distribution also supports that loss of this extracellular antioxidant provides a selective advantage to cancer cells. Moreover, overexpression of EcSOD inhibits tumor growth and metastasis, indicating a role as a tumor suppressor. This review focuses on the current understanding of the mechanisms of deregulation and tumor suppressive function of EcSOD in cancer.

BACKGROUND: The Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) was a National Institutes of Health-funded initiative to develop measures of symptoms and function. Responsiveness is the degree to which a measure can detect underlying changes over time. The objective of the current study was to document the responsiveness of 8 PROMIS measures in a large, population-based cancer cohort. METHODS: The Measuring Your Health study recruited 2968 patients who were diagnosed with 1 of 7 cancers between 2010 and 2012 through 4 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries. Participants completed a baseline survey (6-13 months after diagnosis) and a 6-month follow-up survey. Changes in 8 PROMIS scores were compared with global ratings of transition, changes in performance status, and clinical events. RESULTS: Measures were responsive to 6-month declines and improvements in performance status with small to large effect sizes (ES) (Cohen d = 0.34-0.71; P < .01). Mean changes and effect sizes were larger for participants who reported declines compared with those who reported improvements. Small-to-medium ES were observed in patients who reported being "a little" worse (d = 0.31-0.56), and medium-to-large ES were observed in those who reported being "a lot" worse (d = 0.53-0.72). Hospitalized participants reported significant score increases, resulting in worsening of pain (d = 0.51), fatigue (d = 0.35), and depression (d = 0.57; all P < .01). Cancer recurrence and progression were associated with smaller increases in pain, fatigue, and sleep disturbance (d = 0.22-0.27). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicated that all 8 PROMIS measures were sensitive to patient-perceived worsening and improvement and to major clinical events. These findings will be able to inform the design and interpretation of future research studies and clinical initiatives administering PROMIS measures. Cancer 2017;123:327-335.

BACKGROUND: To improve the management of advanced cancer patients with delirium in an emergency department (ED) setting, we compared outcomes between patients with delirium positively diagnosed by both the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) and Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale (MDAS), or group A (n = 22); by the MDAS only, or group B (n = 22); and by neither CAM nor MDAS, or group C (n = 199). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In an oncologic ED, we assessed 243 randomly selected advanced cancer patients for delirium using the CAM and the MDAS and for presence of advance directives. Outcomes extracted from patients' medical records included hospital and intensive care unit admission rate and overall survival (OS). RESULTS: Hospitalization rates were 82%, 77%, and 49% for groups A, B, and C, respectively (p = .0013). Intensive care unit rates were 18%, 14%, and 2% for groups A, B, and C, respectively (p = .0004). Percentages with advance directives were 52%, 27%, and 43% for groups A, B, and C, respectively (p = .2247). Median OS was 1.23 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-3.55) for group A, 4.70 months (95% CI 0.89-7.85) for group B, and 10.45 months (95% CI 7.46-14.82) for group C. Overall survival did not differ significantly between groups A and B (p = .6392), but OS in group C exceeded those of the other groups (p < .0001 each). CONCLUSION: Delirium assessed by either CAM or MDAS was associated with worse survival and more hospitalization in patients with advanced cancer in an oncologic ED. Many advanced cancer patients with delirium in ED lack advance directives. Delirium should be assessed regularly and should trigger discussion of goals of care and advance directives. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Delirium is a devastating condition among advanced cancer patients. Early diagnosis in the emergency department (ED) should improve management of this life-threatening condition. However, delirium is frequently missed by ED clinicians, and the outcome of patients with delirium is unknown. This study finds that delirium assessed by the Confusion Assessment Method or the Memorial Delirium Assessment Scale is associated with poor survival and more hospitalization among advanced cancer patients visiting the ED of a major cancer center, many of whom lack advance directives. Therefore, delirium in ED patients with cancer should trigger discussion about advance directives.

BACKGROUND: Agricultural workers may be exposed to potential carcinogens including pesticides, sensitizing agents and solar radiation. Previous studies indicate increased risks of hematopoietic cancers and decreased risks at other sites, possibly due to differences in lifestyle or risk behaviours. We present findings from CanCHEC (Canadian Census Health and Environment Cohort), the largest national population-based cohort of agricultural workers. METHODS: Statistics Canada created the cohort using deterministic and probabilistic linkage of the 1991 Canadian Long Form Census to National Cancer Registry records for 1992-2010. Self-reported occupations were coded using the Standard Occupational Classification (1991) system. Analyses were restricted to employed persons aged 25-74 years at baseline (N = 2,051,315), with follow-up until December 31, 2010. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were modeled using Cox proportional hazards for all workers in agricultural occupations (n = 70,570; 70.8% male), stratified by sex, and adjusted for age at cohort entry, province of residence, and highest level of education. RESULTS: A total of 9515 incident cancer cases (7295 in males) occurred in agricultural workers. Among men, increased risks were observed for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 1.00-1.21), prostate (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 1.06-1.16), melanoma (HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.02-1.31), and lip cancer (HR = 2.14, 95% CI = 1.70-2.70). Decreased risks in males were observed for lung, larynx, and liver cancers. Among female agricultural workers there was an increased risk of pancreatic cancer (HR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.07-1.72). Increased risks of melanoma (HR = 1.79, 95% CI = 1.17-2.73), leukemia (HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.24-3.25) and multiple myeloma (HR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.16-4.37) were observed in a subset of female crop farmers. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to pesticides may have contributed to increased risks of hematopoietic cancers, while increased risks of lip cancer and melanoma may be attributed to sun exposure. The array of decreased risks suggests reduced smoking and alcohol consumption in this occupational group compared to the general population.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of socioeconomic and healthcare use characteristics in the participation in breast, cervical and colorectal cancer screening in the French West Indies. We used data from a national health survey conducted in 2014 in Martinique (n=2026) and Guadeloupe (n=2028). Logistic regressions adjusted for various sociodemographic and morbidity variables were performed. The following determinants were investigated: having hot water at home, having received income support for low-income individuals during the last year, educational level, occupational class, complementary health insurance, healthcare renouncement and visit to the general practitioner (GP) during the last year. Multiple imputations were performed to account for missing values. We observed the following cancer screening rates: 78.1% for cervical cancer, 81.5% for breast cancer and 59.5% (women) and 50.8% (men) for colorectal cancer. Higher cervical cancer screening participation was reported among women with qualified occupation and having visited the GP during the last year and lower participation among women who never worked. Higher screening participation was reported among participants having hot water at home and having visited the GP during the last year for breast and colorectal (men and women) cancer. Unexpectedly, a lower colorectal cancer screening participation was found among women with qualified occupation. We observed social inequalities in participation in cancer screening in the French West Indies, which stresses the need to continue efforts to increase screening rates in this population.

BACKGROUND: Current guidelines recommend that metastatic gastric cancer should not be treated with surgery unless this is required for symptom control. We hypothesized that patients with mismatch repair deficiency (MMRd) gastric cancer and metastatic disease detected at the timepoint of surgical resection would have superior survival compared to patients with MMRd cancers in the same setting. METHODS: Clinicopathological details and survival data were collected from prospective databases at two large European centers on patients who had undergone surgery and were diagnosed with synchronous stage IV gastric cancer (distant lymph nodes, positive peritoneal cytology, peritoneal, and distant metastases) at the timepoint of surgery. Resection specimens were tested for the presence of microsatellite instability using a standard 5 mononucleotide repeat panel. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy six patients with resected stage IV gastric cancer were identified. 14/176 (8.0%) had MSI-H (high) disease. There was no significant difference between the clinical and pathological characteristics of MSI and microsatellite stable (MSS) patients. No differences in the type of metastases were observed between MSI and MSS groups. Patients who were MSI-H had superior OS compared to MSS patients (median OS 15.9 vs. 8 months, p = 0.023). However, in Cox regression multivariate analysis only liver and peritoneal metastases were independent predictors of survival. CONCLUSIONS: Surgically treated patients with MSI-H stage IV gastric cancer have a better survival than patients with MSS gastric cancer. Further analysis of the role of surgery in MSI stage IV GC is required.

A major recent advance in cancer therapy involves the use of immune checkpoint therapy for tumors with mismatch repair deficiency, as they have a high tumor mutation load and neoantigen burden. Approximately 4% of advanced colorectal cancer harbors a mismatch repair deficiency. When mismatch repair deficiency exists in the germline, there is increased susceptibility to a variety of cancers including colorectal cancer, uterine cancer, urothelial carcinoma, and skin cancer. Herein we report the case of a 62-year-old man with mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma, urothelial carcinoma and a history of sebaceous carcinomas. As the patient in 2016 was ineligible for clinical trials he received immune checkpoint anti-PD-1 therapy with pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks), on compassionate use basis, after the failure of second-line treatment. The patient's CEA initially responded to pembrolizumab for 4 months and then kept rising for 5 months before mildly declining again. His treatment was then switched to anti-PD-L1 therapy with atezolizumab as it was approved for urothelial carcinoma at that time, and his CEA declined again. This case raises interesting questions about caring for patients with mismatch repair deficient colorectal cancer, including the role of PD-L1 therapy, sequencing of immunotherapy, relying on CEA trends and determining future therapies after progression on pembrolizumab.

Retrospective analysis of data from 14,528 lung cancer patients with multiple primary malignant neoplasm (MPMN) revealed that 2.5% (364/14,528) were MPMN cases and 96.2% (350/364) were diagnosed with two primary malignancies, 3.6% (13/364) with three primary malignancies, and 0.3% (1/364) with four primary malignancies. Among 350 lung cancer patients diagnosed with two primary malignancies, 26.6% (93/350) had lung cancer diagnosed first (LCF) and 73.4% (257/350) had other cancers diagnosed initially (OCF), whereas synchronous MPMN (SMPMN) accounted for 21.1% (74/350) and metachronous MPMN (MMPMN) accounted for 78.9% (276/350) of the cases. Detection of first primary neoplasms were at an early stage for LCF patients and the age of the first lung cancer diagnosis was 59.3 years vs. 55.4 years in the OCF group (P = 0.008), whereas the onset age of second primary neoplasm diagnosis was similar in both groups (62.5 and 61.6 years, P = 0.544). Median survival times of MMPMN and SMPMN patients in the LCF group were 6.83 and 2.42 years and in the OCF group 8.67 years and 2.25 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that SMPMN, LCF and the age of the primary cancer diagnosed first ( >/= 60 years) and NSCL staging > II were significant independent factors for inferior prognosis of patients.

BACKGROUND: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) Revitalization Act of 1993 mandated the appropriate inclusion of minorities in all NIH-funded research. Twenty years after this act, the proportion of minority patients enrolled in cancer clinical trials remains persistently low. Clinical trials are vehicles for the development and evaluation of therapeutic and preventive agents under scientifically rigorous conditions. Without representation in trials, it is projected that disparities in the cancer burden for minorities will increase. METHODS: For this review article, the authors counted the frequency with which minorities were the primary focus of National Cancer Institute-sponsored clinical trials, examined citations from the PubMed database focusing on the search terms "NIH Revitalization Act of 1993" and "enhancing minority accrual to cancer clinical trials," and supplemented the review with their expertise in NIH-funded research related to minority accrual in cancer clinical trials. RESULTS: The reporting and analyses of data based on minorities in clinical trials remain inadequate. Less than 2% of the National Cancer Institute's clinical trials focus on any racial/minority population as their primary emphasis. The current review of the literature indicated that the percentage of authors who reported their study sample by race/ethnicity ranged from 1.5% to 58%, and only 20% of the randomized controlled studies published in a high-impact oncology journal reported analyzing results by race/ethnicity. Proportionately greater population increases in minorities, accompanied by their persistent and disproportionate cancer burden, reinforce the need for their greater representation in clinical trials. CONCLUSIONS: Renewing the emphasis for minority participation in clinical trials is warranted. Policy changes are recommended.

OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to explore the characteristics and outcomes of patients with sepsis accompanied by active cancer who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: The baseline characteristics, infection profiles, and outcomes of patients with sepsis were retrospectively analyzed according to the presence of concomitant active cancer. The association between concomitant active cancer and 28-day mortality was explored. RESULTS: Of 23,956 patients with sepsis, 1574 (6.6%) had concomitant active cancer. The most common type was digestive (30.7%). The 28-day mortality ranged from 41.9% to 81.5%. Patients with active cancer had a significantly higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score II and significantly shorter length of ICU stay. Respiratory (32.9%), genitourinary (31.0%), and bloodstream (17.0%) infections were most common. Escherichia coli was the most frequent gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. The 28-day mortality rate was significantly higher in patients with than without active cancer. Concomitant active cancer was associated with increased 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis. Hematological malignancy was associated with a significantly higher risk of death than solid tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Concomitant active cancer was associated with higher 28-day mortality in patients with sepsis requiring ICU admission. Hematological malignancy was associated with a higher risk of death than solid tumors.

Adoptive transfer of T cells engineered to express chimeric immunoreceptors is an effective strategy to treat hematologic cancers; however, the use of this type of therapy for solid cancers, such as ovarian cancer, remains challenging because a safe and effective immunotherapeutic target has not yet been identified. Here, we constructed and evaluated a novel redirected T-cell-based immunotherapy targeting human follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR), a highly conserved molecule in vertebrate animals with expression limited to gonadal tissues, ovarian cancer, and cancer-associated vasculature. Receptor ligand-based anti-FSHR immunoreceptors were constructed that contained small binding fragments from the ligand for FSHR, FSH, fused to T-cell transmembrane and T-cell signaling domains. Human T cells transduced to express anti-FSHR immunoreceptors were specifically immunoreactive against FSHR-expressing human and mouse ovarian cancer cell lines in an MHC-nonrestricted manner and mediated effective lysis of FHSR-expressing tumor cells, but not FSHR-deficient targets, in vitro. Similarly, the outgrowth of human ovarian cancer xenografts in immunodeficient mice was significantly inhibited by the adoptive transfer of FSHR-redirected T cells. Our experimental observations show that FSHR is a promising immunotherapeutic target for ovarian cancer and support further exploration of FSHR-targeted immune therapy approaches for patients with cancer.

BACKGROUND: Genomic testing in cancer (GTC) characterizes genes that play an important role in the development and growth of a patient's cancer. This form of DNA testing is currently being studied for its ability to guide cancer therapy. The objective of the current study was to describe patients' knowledge, attitudes, and expectations toward GTC. METHODS: A 42-item self-administered GTC questionnaire was developed by a multidisciplinary group and patient pretesting. The questionnaire was distributed to patients with advanced cancer who were referred to the Princess Margaret Cancer Center for a phase 1 clinical trial or GTC testing. RESULTS: Results were reported from 98 patients with advanced cancer, representing 66% of the patients surveyed. Seventy-six percent of patients were interested in learning more about GTC, and 64% reported that GTC would significantly improve their cancer care. The median score on a 12-item questionnaire to assess knowledge of cancer genomics was 8 of 12 items correct (67%; interquartile range, 7-9 of 12 items correct [58%-75%]). Scores were associated significantly with patients' education level (P < .0001). Sixty-six percent of patients would consent to a needle biopsy, and 39% would consent to an invasive surgical biopsy if required for GTC. Only 48% of patients reported having sufficient knowledge to make an informed decision to pursue GTC whereas 34% of patients indicated a need for formal genetic counseling. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with advanced cancer are motivated to participate in GTC. Patients require further education to understand the difference between somatic and germline mutations in the context of GTC. Educational programs are needed to support patients interested in pursuing GTC.

BACKGROUND: To ensure that National Institutes of Health-funded research is relevant to the population's needs, specific emphasis on proportional representation of minority/sex groups into National Cancer Institute (NCI) cancer centers' clinical research programs is reported to the NCI. METHODS: EMPaCT investigators at 5 regionally diverse comprehensive cancer centers compared data reported to the NCI for their most recent Cancer Center Support Grant competitive renewal to assess and compare the centers' catchment area designations, data definitions, data elements, collection processes, reporting, and performance regarding proportional representation of race/ethnicity and sex subsets. RESULTS: Cancer centers' catchment area definitions differed widely in terms of their cancer patient versus general population specificity, levels of specificity, and geographic coverage. Racial/ethnic categories were similar, yet were defined differently, across institutions. Patients' socioeconomic status and insurance status were inconsistently captured across the 5 centers. CONCLUSIONS: Catchment area definitions and the collection of patient-level demographic factors varied widely across the 5 comprehensive cancer centers. This challenged the assessment of success by cancer centers in accruing representative populations into the cancer research enterprise. Accrual of minorities was less than desired for at least 1 racial/ethnic subcategory at 4 of the 5 centers. Institutions should clearly and consistently declare their primary catchment area and the rationale and should report how race/ethnicity and sex are defined, determined, collected, and reported. More standardized, frequent, consistent collection, reporting, and review of these data are recommended, as is a commitment to collecting socioeconomic data, given that socioeconomic status is a primary driver of cancer disparities in the United States.

BACKGROUND: The percentage of adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with cancer (those aged 15-39 years) diagnosed at a distant stage of disease did not significantly change between 1975 and 2004. It has been hypothesized that a lack of health insurance may be a significant risk factor for a diagnosis of distant-stage disease among AYA patients, but to the authors' knowledge this has not been examined in a national sample. METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base, a hospital-based cancer registry, was used to obtain data regarding incident cancer cases among patients aged 15 years to 39 years who were diagnosed between 2004 and 2010. After all exclusions, a total of 285,448 cases were available for analysis; all AYA cancer sites were included. A retrospective study was conducted to assess the association between insurance status and stage of disease at diagnosis. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, facility type, ZIP code-based income and education levels, and US Census region, it was found that among males, uninsured patients were 1.51 times more likely to be diagnosed at a distant stage of disease compared with patients with private insurance (95% confidence interval, 1.46-1.55). Among females, the effect of insurance was stronger, with uninsured patients found to be 1.86 times more likely to be diagnosed at a distant stage (95% confidence interval, 1.79-1.94). The effect of insurance status was substantially stronger for malignancies that are more amenable to early detection (melanoma, thyroid carcinoma, breast carcinoma, genitourinary carcinoma), and substantially weaker for those that are less amenable to early detection (lung carcinoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, Wilms tumor). CONCLUSIONS: In a large national sample of AYA patients with cancer, insurance status was found to be a strong independent risk factor for distant-stage disease at the time of diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Historically, three founder mutations in the BRCA1/2 (OMIM 113705; OMIM 600185) genes have been the focus of cancer risks within the Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) population. However, there are several additional mutations associated with increased susceptibility to cancer in individuals of AJ ancestry. METHODS: We report three patients who exemplify the need to keep these additional founder mutations in mind when pursuing hereditary cancer genetic testing of individuals in this population. All gene sequences in this paper were aligned to reference sequences based on human genome build GRCh37/UCSC hg19. RESULTS: review of the literature discusses that the combined risk is 12.36%-20.83% forhaving 1 of the 10 hereditary cancer AJ founder mutations in the BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2 (OMIM 604373), APC (OMIM 611731), MSH2 (OMIM 609309), MSH6 (OMIM 600678), and GREM1 (OMIM 603054) genes for individuals of AJ ancestry. CONCLUSION: We recommend testing for all 10 of these AJ founder cancer susceptibility mutations for individuals within this population as standard screening in order to ensure appropriate cancer risk management and cascade testing.

Diverse plant products (e.g. fruits, vegetables, legumes) are associated with decreased cancer risk at several locations while red and processed meat were found to increase cancer risk. A pro plant-based dietary score reflecting the relative contribution of consumed plant vs animal products was developed, and was associated with lower overall mortality, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease risk, among omnivorous adults. For the first time, we investigated the prospective associations between this pro plant-based dietary score and cancer risk. This study included 42,544 men and women of the French NutriNet-Sante prospective cohort (2009-2016) aged >/=45 years who completed at least three 24-hr-dietary records during the first year of follow-up. The risk of developing cancer was compared across sex-specific tertiles of pro plant-based dietary score by multivariable Cox models. In total, 1,591 first primary incident cancer cases were diagnosed during follow-up, among which 487 breast, 243 prostate, 198 digestive and 68 lung cancers. A higher pro plant-based dietary score was associated with decreased risks of overall (HRt3vs.t1 =0.85; 95% CI 0.76, 0.97; Ptrend =0.02), digestive (HRt3vs.t1 =0.68; 95% CI 0.47; 0.99; Ptrend = 0.04) and lung (HRt3vs.t1 =0.47; 95% CI 0.25, 0.90; Ptrend =0.02) cancer, though no substantial associations were found for breast or prostate cancers. This large cohort study supports a beneficial role of higher intakes of plant-based products along with lower intakes of animal products, within a balanced omnivorous diet, regarding primary cancer prevention. These results are consistent with mechanistic evidence from experimental studies.

Noncentral nervous system cancer and the brain share an interesting and complex relation, with an emerging body of evidence showing that cancer patients are at an increased risk of developing cognitive problems. In contrast, population-based studies consistently find an inverse link between cancer and dementia, that is patients with dementia having a lower risk of subsequently developing cancer, and cancer patients being less often diagnosed with dementia. Different biological processes such as inversely activated cell proliferation and survival pathways have been suggested to have an important role underlying this inverse association. However, the effect of methodological biases including surveillance or survival bias has not been completely ruled out, calling into question the inverse direction of the association between cancer and dementia. In fact, emerging evidence now suggests that cancer and dementia might share a positive association. This narrative review summarises the current literature on cancer, cognitive problems and dementia. Moreover, different strategies will be discussed to reduce the impact of potential methodological biases on the association between cancer and dementia, trying to reveal the true direction of this link.

BACKGROUND: To expand the library of promoters that can be used for expression-targeted gene delivery to cancer cells, the specificity and strength of expression of three cancer-related gene promoters was evaluated: RAS-related nuclear protein ((P) ran), breast cancer metastasis suppressor 1 ((P) brms1) and minichromosome maintenance complex component 5 ((P) mcm5). METHODS: The expression of reporter genes under the control of these promoters demonstrated selectivity in cancer cell lines of breast, prostate and ovarian origins versus a panel of normal cell types. The (P) ran was next used to regulate the expression of a bioactive exon (a constitutively active form of human caspase 3) to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. Further evaluation was performed in an orthotopic model of murine bladder cancer. RESULTS: The average strengths of reporter expression had relative intensities of 99.8% ((P) ran), 87.7% ((P) brms1) and 55.8% ((P) mcm5) versus the strong (P) cmv-driven positive control. Comparisons of expression-targeted reporter gene expression for these three promoters versus the clinically interesting promoter for the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene ((P) hTERT) yielded an improvement of two- to 15-fold. Following transfection, cell death was evident from morphologic observations and viability assays performed on the cancer cells lines, with little (if any) effects seen when the same genes were delivered to normal cells. Cell viability was reduced by up to 60% after one treatment, with cell death via apoptosis implied by caspase 3 detection. During the in vivo preclinical study, reduced tumor burden, lack of mineralization and decreased inflammation were demonstrated after only three treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The ran, brms1, and mcm5 promoters have the specificity and strength needed for cancer-specific expression-targeted gene therapy. (p) ran in particular produced exciting results when coupled with a version of the caspase 3 exon to treat bladder cancer. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Inflammation is proposed to increase risk of developing endometrial cancer, but few prospective epidemiologic studies have investigated the relationship between circulating inflammation markers and endometrial cancer risk. In a nested case-control study within the PLCO Screening Trial we measured serum levels of 64 inflammation-related biomarkers in 284 incident endometrial cancer cases and 284 matched controls. Using multivariable logistic regression inflammation markers were evaluated individually and combined into a cross-validated inflammation score. Of 64 markers, 22 were associated with endometrial cancer risk at p < 0.05 and 17 of 22 markers remained associated after multiple testing corrections. After adjusting for BMI and estradiol, SERPINE1 [quartile(Q)4 vs. Q1 odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)), p trend = 2.43 (0.94-6.29), 0.03] and VEGFA [2.56 (1.52-4.30), 0.0002] were positively associated with endometrial cancer risk, while CCL3 [0.46 (0.27-0.77), 0.01], IL13 [0.55 (0.33-0.93), 0.01], IL21 [0.52 (0.31-0.87), 0.01], IL1B [0.51 (0.30-0.86), 0.01] and IL23 [0.60 (0.35-1.03), 0.02] were inversely associated with risk. We observed large differences in ORs across BMI-inflammation score categories. Endometrial cancer risk was most pronounced among obese women with the highest inflammation score tertile (T) [10.25 (3.56-29.55) vs. normal BMI/T1]. Several inflammation markers were prospectively associated with endometrial cancer, including adipokines, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, angiogenic factors and acute phase proteins. Inverse associations with anti-inflammatory markers (IL13, IL21), other inflammation markers/mediators (CCL3, IL1B, IL23), and a robust positive association between VEGFA and endometrial cancer risk were independent of BMI and estradiol, suggesting that these factors may influence risk through other mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: Cancer causes significant morbidity and mortality among HIV patients in the US due to extended life expectancy with access to effective antiretroviral therapy. Low, detectable HIV RNA has been studied as a risk factor for adverse health outcomes, but its clinical impact on cancer risk remains unclear. The objective of this study was to determine whether HIV RNA <1,000 copies/mL six months after starting therapy was associated with 10-year first cancer risk. METHODS: We followed 7,515 HIV therapy initiators from a US-based multicenter clinical cohort from 1998 to 2014. We used nonparametric multiple imputation to account for viral loads that fell below assay detection limits, and categorized viral loads six months after therapy initiation into four groups: <20, 20-199, 200-999, and >999 copies/mL. We calculated estimates of the cumulative incidence of cancer diagnosis, accounting for death as a competing event. Inverse probability of exposure and censoring weights were used to control for confounding and differential loss to follow up, respectively. RESULTS: Crude 10-year first cancer risk in the study sample was 7.03% (95% CI: 6.08%, 7.98%), with the highest risk observed among patients with viral loads between 200 and 999 copies/mL six months after ART initiation (10.7%). After controlling for baseline confounders, 10-year first cancer risk was 6.90% (95% CI: 5.69%, 8.12%), and was similar across viral load categories. CONCLUSION: Overall risk of first cancer was not associated with incomplete viral suppression; however, cancer remains a significant threat to HIV patients after treatment initiation. As more HIV patients gain access to treatment in the current "treat all" era, occurrences of incomplete viral suppression will be observed more frequently in clinical practice, which supports continued study of the role of low-level HIV RNA on cancer development.

OBJECTIVES: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a single-stranded RNA virus infecting a variety of animals and humans. Little is known of HEV infection among cancer patients in China. This study provides new epidemiological data for the prevalence of HEV co-infection in cancer patients, indicating that HEV infection is common in this group. METHODS: A total of 950 cancer patients and 950 control volunteers from Shandong Province, eastern China, were recruited to participate in this investigation. Blood samples from patients and controls were examined for anti-HEV IgG and IgM antibodies using ELISAs. RESULTS: The overall seroprevalence of IgG and IgM antibodies to HEV was significantly higher in cancer patients (247/950, 26.0%) than in controls (123/950, 13.0%) (p<0.001). In cancer patients, 22.7% of serum samples were anti-HEV IgG-positive, and in control subjects, 11.0% were anti-HEV IgG-positive (p<0.001). For IgM antibodies, seroprevalence was 4.2% in cancer patients (n=40) and 2.1% in controls (n=20) (p=0.009). The seroprevalence of HEV was higher in cancer patients who had dogs in their home (31.7%) when compared to other cancer patients. The highest seroprevalence of HEV infection was found in leukemia patients (32.3%), followed by liver cancer patients (31.1%); the lowest HEV seroprevalence was detected in patients with gastric cancer (18.9%). CONCLUSIONS: This investigation revealed that the seroprevalence of HEV was significantly higher in cancer patients than in controls in eastern China. Therefore, cancer patients are a high-risk population and should be kept away from sources of HEV infection.

BACKGROUND: Previously proposed criteria for preoperatively identifying endometrial cancer patients at low risk for lymph node metastasis remain to be verified. For this purpose, a prospective, multicenter observational study was performed. METHODS: Eligible patients with histologically confirmed endometrial cancer underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and serum cancer antigen 125 (CA 125) testing before surgery. The following criteria were used to identify low-risk patients: 1) endometrioid-type cancer, 2) no evidence of deep myometrial invasion on MRI, 3) no enlarged lymph nodes on MRI, 4) no suspicious metastasis out of the uterine corpus, and 5) serum CA 125 levels less than 35 U/mL. Systematic pelvic and/or para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed for all patients. The primary endpoint was estimation of the negative predictive value (NPV). RESULTS: From January 2012 to December 2014, 529 patients from 20 hospitals in 3 Asian countries were consecutively enrolled. According to our criteria, 272 patients (51.4%) were categorized into the low-risk group. Fifty-three of the 529 patients (10.0%) had lymph node metastases; these patients included 8 (2.9%) falsely categorized as low-risk. The sensitivity and specificity of the criteria were 84.9% and 55.5%, respectively. The NPV of 97.1% was higher than the predefined target endpoint of 96%. CONCLUSIONS: The low-risk criteria based on preoperative tests were confirmed to be reliable and accurate for identifying patients at low risk for lymph node metastasis. These criteria may facilitate patient counseling and surgical decision making. Cancer 2017;123:263-272. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

Redox regulation has been proposed to control various aspects of carcinogenesis, cancer cell growth, metabolism, migration, invasion, metastasis and cancer vascularization. As cancer has many faces, the role of redox control in different cancers and in the numerous cancer-related processes often point in different directions. In this review, we focus on the redox control mechanisms of tumor cell destruction. The review covers the tumor-intrinsic role of oxidants derived from the reduction of oxygen and nitrogen in the control of tumor cell proliferation as well as the roles of oxidants and antioxidant systems in cancer cell death caused by traditional anticancer weapons (chemotherapeutic agents, radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy). Emphasis is also put on the role of oxidants and redox status in the outcome following interactions between cancer cells, cytotoxic lymphocytes and tumor infiltrating macrophages.

BACKGROUND: Current evidence on risk of prostate cancer following a diagnosis of male breast cancer is limited and guidance for screening in this potentially higher-risk population remainsunclear. Our objective was to quantify prostate cancer risk in men diagnosed with breast cancer. METHODS: We identified men diagnosed with first primary breast cancer between 1988 and 2012 using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Program registry databases. Men were followed for occurrence of a second primary prostate cancer and secondary outcomes of cancer-specific and overall survival. Stratified analyses were performed by age, breast cancer stage, race, and breast cancer hormone receptor status. Excess risk per 10,000 person-years and standardized incidence ratios (SIR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated. We used multivaraible Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% CI for characteristics associated with secondary prostate cancer and survival. RESULTS: From a cohort of 5753 men with breast cancer with median follow up of 4.3 years, we identified 250 cases of second primary prostate cancer. Overall, the incidence of second primary prostate cancer was modestly greater than expected (SIR = 1.12, 95% CI 0.93-1.33), although not statistically significant. Stratified analyses demonstrated associations for men ages 65-74 at the time of breast cancer diagnosis (SIR = 1.34, 95%CI 1.01-1.73), hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (SIR = 1.23, 95%CI 1.11-1.39) or AJCC stage I breast cancer (SIR = 1.36, 95%CI 1.04-1.75) and second primary prostate cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of prostate cancer in men with history of breast cancer is similar to the general population. Men with favorable characteristics of their breast cancer were more likely to develop prostate cancer, possibly due to a lower competing risk of breast cancer mortality.

The focus of the study is the analysis of changes in health-related quality of life in various cancer entities during and after an inpatient rehabilitation programme. In a multicentre longitudinal study, a total of 211 cancer patients (breast cancer: N = 84; prostate cancer: N = 90; colon cancer: N = 37) were asked about their quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30; HADS) at the beginning, the end and 3 months after the end of the rehabilitation programme. In different domains of quality of life significant and mostly clinically relevant improvements were found during rehabilitation. The breast and prostate cancer patients improved most in emotional functioning, colon cancer patients in global quality of life. With regard to the severity of symptoms, the fatigue burden improved in breast and colon cancer patients, nausea in the prostate cancer patients. However, they are increases 3 months after rehabilitation. Functional burdens improved 3 months after the end of rehabilitation in the physical domain for all cancer patients. For breast cancer patients, emotional functioning decreased significantly 3 months after rehabilitation. An inpatient oncological rehabilitation programme can lead to an improvement in quality of life.

BACKGROUND: Access to and advice on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) are uncommon within Swedish conventional cancer care and little is known about cancer patients' own use of CAM. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to explore Swedish cancer patients patterns of CAM use, their experiences and preferences. METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed consecutively to 1297 cancer patients at a university hospital's out-patient oncology units. The response rate was 58% (n = 755). Descriptive statistics were used to analyze the survey data. A logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between CAM use and gender, age and level of education. Open-ended responses were analyzed, using qualitative content analysis. RESULTS: Lifetime CAM use was reported by 34% (n = 256), and 26% (n = 198) used CAM after cancer diagnosis. Being female, younger and having higher education predicted CAM use. Most commonly used methods were natural products including vitamins and minerals and relaxation. Main reasons for CAM use were improvement of physical, general and emotional wellbeing and increasing the body's ability to fight cancer. Satisfaction with CAM usage was generally high. Reported adverse effects were few and mild; 54% of users spent < 50 Euro a month on CAM. One third had discussed their CAM use with cancer care providers. More than half of all participants thought that cancer care providers should be able to discuss (58%) and to consider (54%) use of CAM modalities in cancer care. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited access and advice within conventional cancer care, one fourth of Swedish cancer patients use CAM. The insufficient patient-provider dialogue diverges with most patients' wish for professional guidance in their decisions and integration of CAM modalities in conventional cancer care. Concurrent and multimodal CAM use implies challenges and possibilities for cancer care that need to be considered.

BACKGROUND: Renal complications are a relevant clinical issue in patients with cancer; conversely, cancer in patients affected by kidney diseases is a growing problem mainly due to the aging of the general population. Onco-Nephrology is a novel subspecialty addressing these issues. SUMMARY: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in cancer patients, and recognizes a number of different causes, which can impact, directly and indirectly, on kidney function. Furthermore, the appearance of AKI may have a tremendously negative impact on oncological treatments, often denying cancer patients active and life-prolonging treatments. Overall, patients with cancer are at risk of AKI, which could be caused by antineoplastic treatments, sepsis, metabolic disturbances, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, primary thrombotic micro-angiopathies, and direct involvement of the kidney by hematological malignancies and also by solid cancer, in particular kidney and urothelial malignancies. Key Messages: (1) AKI is a frequent and increasing complication of cancer. (2) There is a bidirectional relationship between cancer and kidney disease, and in both cases, AKI is more likely to happen. (3) AKI in patients with cancer is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. (4) In cancer patients, a multidisciplinary approach and early intervention may reduce the incidence of AKI and its life-threatening consequences. (5) Onco-Nephrology is a growing area of nephrology that requires clinicians to have a better understanding of the renal complications of cancer including AKI.

BACKGROUND: Brief tools are needed to screen oncology outpatients for depressive symptoms. METHODS: Patients starting radiotherapy for the first diagnosis of any tumor completed distress screening tools, including the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2), the National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer (NCCN-DT), and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL) (25-item version). Patients exceeding validated cutoff scores and a systematic sample of patients whose screening was negative completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) mood disorder modules via telephone. RESULTS: Four hundred sixty-three patients from 35 community-based radiation oncology sites and 2 academic radiation oncology sites were recruited. Sixty-six percent of the 455 eligible patients (n = 299) were women, and the eligible patients had breast (45%), gastrointestinal (11%), lung (10%), gynecologic (6%), or other cancers (27%). Seventy-five (16.5%) exceeded screening cutoffs for depressive symptoms. Forty-two of these patients completed the SCID. Another 37 patients whose screening was negative completed the SCID. Among the 79 patients completing the SCID, 8 (10.1%) met the criteria for major depression, 2 (2.5%) met the criteria for dysthymia, and 6 (7.6%) met the criteria for an adjustment disorder. The PHQ-2 demonstrated good psychometric properties for screening for mood disorders with a cutoff score of >/=3 (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve [AUC], 0.83) and was comparable to the PHQ-9 ( > 9; AUC = 0.85). The NCCN-DT did not detect depression (AUC = 0.59). CONCLUSIONS: The PHQ-2 demonstrated good psychometric properties for screening for mood disorders, which were equivalent to the PHQ-9 and superior to the NCCN-DT. These findings support using the PHQ-2 to identify patients in need of further assessment for depression, which has a low prevalence but is a clinically significant comorbidity. These findings could inform the implementation of distress screening accreditation standards. Cancer 2017;123:485-493. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

AIMS: The New Zealand Provisional Standards of Service Provision for Cancer recommend providing patients with written information about their diagnosis, treatment and follow up. This project aimed to develop and evaluate a resource that could be used to provide essential information to patients who were nearing completion of the surgical treatment of their cancer. METHODS: The study compared patients with melanoma, colorectal and breast cancers who received standard discussion of their diagnosis, treatment and follow-up plan with cancer patients who received a discussion supported by an individualised follow-up booklet. Patients were interviewed using an over-the-phone questionnaire to assess their free recall and prompted recall of follow-up items, their perception of the level of information received and satisfaction with the communication of their follow-up plan. RESULTS: The group who received a booklet as part of discussion of their follow-up plan scored significantly higher on measures of free recall, prompted recall, satisfaction with the level of information provided and overall satisfaction than those who had a standard clinic discussion but did not receive a booklet. Free recall of two relevant items improved from 61% of patients to 91%. Prompted recall of at least one item improved from 77% of patients to 100%. The proportion of patients feeling they did not receive enough information fell from 25% to 5%. The proportion of patients scoring their satisfaction at >8/10 increased from 68% to 87%. All of these measures reached significance. CONCLUSION: Individualised cancer follow-up booklets are a simple, low-cost and low-risk initiative that used in a New Zealand setting, was associated with improved patient recall and satisfaction with the follow-up information they received. This supports the benefit of providing participants with personalised written information, as recommended in the New Zealand Provisional Standards of Service Provision for Cancer.

Members of the inositol phosphate metabolism pathway regulate cell proliferation, migration and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling, and are frequently dysregulated in cancer. Whether germline genetic variants in inositol phosphate metabolism pathway are associated with cancer risk remains to be clarified. We examined the association between inositol phosphate metabolism pathway genes and risk of eight types of cancer using data from genome-wide association studies. Logistic regression models were applied to evaluate SNP-level associations. Gene- and pathway-based associations were tested using the permutation-based adaptive rank-truncated product method. The overall inositol phosphate metabolism pathway was significantly associated with risk of lung cancer (P = 2.00 x 10(-4)), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (P = 5.70 x 10(-3)), gastric cancer (P = 3.03 x 10(-2)) and renal cell carcinoma (P = 1.26 x 10(-2)), but not with pancreatic cancer (P = 1.40 x 10(-1)), breast cancer (P = 3.03 x 10(-1)), prostate cancer (P = 4.51 x 10(-1)), and bladder cancer (P = 6.30 x 10(-1)). Our results provide a link between inherited variation in the overall inositol phosphate metabolism pathway and several individual genes and cancer. Further studies will be needed to validate these positive findings, and to explore its mechanisms.

CONTEXT: Cranial radiation therapy (CRT) predisposes to GH deficiency and subsequent neoplasms (SNs) of the central nervous system (CNS). Increased rates of SNs have been reported in GH-treated survivors. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to evaluate the association between GH treatment and the development of CNS-SNs. DESIGN: The study was designed with a retrospective cohort with longitudinal follow-up. SETTING: The setting of the study was multiinstitutional. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 12 098 5-year pediatric cancer survivors from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study, diagnosed with cancer prior to age 21 years, of whom 338 self-reported GH treatment, which was verified through medical record review. INTERVENTIONS: INTERVENTIONS included subject surveys, medical records abstraction, and pathological review. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incidence of meningioma, glioma, and other CNS-SNs was measured. RESULTS: Among GH-treated survivors, 16 (4.7%) developed CNS-SN, including 10 with meningioma and six with glioma. Two hundred three survivors without GH treatment (1.7%) developed CNS-SN, including 138 with meningioma, 49 with glioma, and 16 with other CNS-SNs. The adjusted rate ratio in GH-treated compared with untreated survivors for development of any CNS-SN was 1.0 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.6-1.8, P = .94], for meningiomas, 0.8 (95% CI 0.4-1.7, P = .61), and for gliomas, 1.9 (95% CI 0.7-4.8, P = .21). Factors associated with meningioma development included female gender (P = .001), younger age at primary cancer diagnosis (P < .001), and CRT/longer time since CRT (P < .001). Glioma was associated with CRT/shorter time since CRT (P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: There was no statistically significant increased overall risk of the occurrence of a CNS-SN associated with GH exposure. Specifically, occurrence of meningiomas and gliomas were not associated with GH treatment.

BACKGROUND: Racial disparities in cancer survival outcomes have been primarily attributed to underlying biologic mechanisms and the quality of cancer care received. Because prior literature shows little difference exists in the socioeconomic status of non-Hispanic whites and Asian Americans, any difference in cancer survival is less likely to be attributable to inequalities of care. We sought to examine differences in cancer-specific survival between whites and Asian Americans. METHODS: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program was used to identify patients with lung (n = 130 852 [16.9%]), breast (n = 313 977 [40.4%]), prostate (n = 166 529 [21.4%]), or colorectal (n = 165 140 [21.3%]) cancer (the three leading causes of cancer-related mortality within each sex) diagnosed between 1991 and 2007. Fine and Gray's competing risks regression compared the cancer-specific mortality (CSM) of eight Asian American groups (Chinese, Filipino, Hawaiian/Pacific Islander, Japanese, Korean, other Asian, South Asian [Indian/Pakistani], and Vietnamese) to non-Hispanic white patients. All P values were two-sided. RESULTS: In competing risks regression, the receipt of definitive treatment was an independent predictor of CSM (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.37, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.35 to 0.40; HR = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.53 to 0.58; HR = 0.61, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.62; and HR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.25 to 0.29) for prostate, breast, lung, and colorectal cancers respectively, all P < .001). In adjusted analyses, most Asian subgroups (except Hawaiians and Koreans) had lower CSM relative to white patients, with hazard ratios ranging from 0.54 (95% CI = 0.38 to 0.78) to 0.88 (95% CI = 0.84 to 0.93) for Japanese patients with prostate and Chinese patients with lung cancer, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Despite adjustment for potential confounders, including the receipt of definitive treatment and tumor characteristics, most Asian subgroups had better CSM than non-Hispanic white patients. These findings suggest that underlying genetic/biological differences, along with potential cultural variations, may impact survival in Asian American cancer patients.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of second primary non-breast cancer after breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, and its correlation with clinicopathological features. METHODS: Data from 21,527 patients with primary breast cancer were collected retrospectively in a single cancer centre; 4.1% of the women developed a second non-breast cancer. The most frequently observed second primary tumor affected the digestive tract (27.8%). The frequency of observed cancers was similar to that expected in the general population, excepting for an excess of melanoma [SIR 1.98 (1.52-2.53)], uterine cancers [SIR 1.44 (1.17-1.74)], ovarian cancers [SIR 1.67 (1.31-2.10)], thyroid tumors [SIR 1.54 (1.23-1.92)], and leukemia [SIR 1.57 (1.11-2.16)]. RESULTS: Clinicopathological breast cancer stratification showed a general increased risk of developing a second cancer in older patients, excluding ovarian cancer. An increased risk of developing ovarian cancer after breast cancer diagnosis was observed, in particular, in triple-negative [HR 3.47 (1.91-6.29)], G3 tumors [HR 2.54 (1.10-5.83)] and in positive breast cancer family history [HR 2.19 (1.22-3.94)]. Breast cancer survivors in hormonal therapy treatment are at higher risk for developing a second thyroid cancer [HR 4.00 (1.46-10.9)]. Conversely, adjuvant chemotherapy offered a protective effect on thyroid cancer risk development [HR 0.46 (0.28-0.76)]. CONCLUSIONS: Older age represents the major risk of developing a second primary non-breast cancer, excluding ovarian cancer. Clinical surveillance is required to prevent ovarian and thyroid cancers, respectively, in patients with positive family history, triple negative, G3 breast cancer and during hormonal therapy treatment in postmenopausal status.

CONTEXT: The number of older adults with cancer is expected to increase rapidly in the upcoming decades. Aging is heterogeneous and chronological age is often not reflective of biological age. A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is an in-depth assessment of multiple domains of health that results in better assessment of a patient's overall health and fitness and allows directed intervention to improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To review the value of CGA for older adults with cancer, CGA composition and tools that can be utilized, and the feasibility of including CGA in oncologic practice. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The currently available evidence on CGA for older adults with cancer was reviewed. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: A CGA can highlight unidentified health problems and identify patients at higher risk of mortality, functional decline, surgical complications, chemotherapy intolerance, and chemotherapy toxicity. It has been shown that CGA is feasible in the oncology clinic, but geriatric screening tools may be useful to specifically identify patients who would benefit from a full CGA. CONCLUSIONS: CGA is feasible and can identify patients at higher risk of adverse events such as mortality, functional decline, surgical complications, and chemotherapy toxicity. Clinicians should consider incorporating CGA when assessing and caring for older adults with cancer. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we review the benefits of a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), a detailed in-depth assessment that identifies health problems not typically identified during routine assessments, for older adults with cancer. We describe the different domains of the CGA and suggest tools to utilize, as well as ways to incorporate CGA into the cancer care setting.

Metastases constitute the greatest causes of deaths from cancer. However, no effective therapeutic options currently exist for cancer patients with metastasis. Estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta), as a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily, shows potent tumor-suppressive activities in many cancers. To investigate whether modulation of ERbeta could serve as a therapeutic strategy for cancer metastasis, we examined whether the selective ERbeta agonist LY500307 could suppress lung metastasis of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and melanoma. Mechanistically, while we observed that LY500307 potently induced cell death of cancer cells metastasized to lung in vivo, it does not mediate apoptosis of cancer cells in vitro, indicating that the cell death-inducing effects of LY500307 might be mediated by the tumor microenvironment. Pathological examination combined with flow cytometry assays indicated that LY500307 treatment induced significant infiltration of neutrophils in the metastatic niche. Functional experiments demonstrated that LY500307-treated cancer cells show chemotactic effects for neutrophils and that in vivo neutrophil depletion by Ly6G antibody administration could reverse the effects of LY500307-mediated metastasis suppression. RNA sequencing analysis showed that LY500307 could induce up-regulation of IL-1beta in TNBC and melanoma cells, which further triggered antitumor neutrophil chemotaxis. However, the therapeutic effects of LY500307 treatment for suppression of lung metastasis was attenuated in IL1B(-/-) murine models, due to failure to induce antitumor neutrophil infiltration in the metastatic niche. Collectively, our study demonstrated that pharmacological activation of ERbeta could augment innate immunity to suppress cancer metastatic colonization to lung, thus providing alternative therapeutic options for cancer patients with metastasis.

TLR3 belong to the Toll-like receptors family, it is mainly expressed on immune cells where it senses pathogen-associated molecular patterns and initiates innate immune response. TLR3 agonist poly(I:C) was developed to mimic pathogens infection and boost immune system activation to promote anti-cancer therapy. Accordingly, TLR agonists were included in the National Cancer Institute list of immunotherapeutic agents with the highest potential to cure cancer. Besides well known effects on immune cells, poly(I:C) was also shown, in experimental models, to directly induce apoptosis in cancer cells expressing TLR3. This review presents the current knowledge on the mechanism of poly(I:C)-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. Experimental evidences on positive or negative regulators of TLR3-mediated apoptosis induced by poly(I:C) are reported and strategies are proposed to successfully promote this event in cancer cells. Cancer cells apoptosis is an additional arm offered by poly(I:C), besides activation of immune system, for the treatment of various type of cancer. A further dissection of TLR3 signaling would contribute to greater resolution of the critical steps that impede full exploitation of the poly(I:C)-induced apoptosis. Experimental evidences about negative regulator of poly(I:C)-induced apoptotic program should be considered in combinations with TLR3 agonists in clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: There is renewed interest in flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) colorectal cancer (CRC) screening following trials showing significantly reduced CRC incidence and mortality. AIMS: To evaluate the potential usefulness of FS screening in our population. METHODS: We examined rectosigmoid (RS) cancer epidemiology in our Jewish population using Israel National Cancer Registry data, computed by CRC site, age groups, and gender. We also reviewed endoscopy-screening publications for prevalence of RS and proximal advanced adenomas (AAP) and having both or either. RESULTS: During 1980-2008, there were 64,559 CRCs registered; 31.6 % were RS cancer which has now decreased to 29 % of men's and 26 % of women's CRC (both P < 0.01). In <50 year olds, RS cancer occurred in 42 % of males' and 35 % of females' CRC, and in the last 2 decades this ratio is unchanged. In 50-74 year olds, RS cancer decreased to stable levels of 32 % of males' and 29 % females' CRC (both P < 0.01). In >/=75 year olds, RS cancer progressively decreased to 24 % of males' and 22 % females' CRC (both P < 0.001). From endoscopy screening reports in 40-79 year olds, RS AAPs occurred in 2.0-5.8 %, being least in women, most in men, and not increased with aging. Some 50-57 % of screenees had both RS and proximal AAPs, least when aged 40-49 years at 25 %, women were 35 %, and with aging 40 %, but most in men at 70 %. CONCLUSIONS: With the changing CRC epidemiology, having fewer RS neoplasms but more proximal cancer, the effectiveness of FS screening for identifying significant neoplasms decreases with screenees' age and especially in females. These make FS screening less suitable for our aging and increasingly female population.

BACKGROUND: The current study was performed to determine, in rural settings, the relation between the type and status of insurance coverage and being up-to-date for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. METHODS: Four primary care practices in 2 rural Oregon communities participated. Medical chart reviews that were conducted between October 2008 and August 2009 assessed insurance coverage and up-to-date status for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening. Inclusion criteria involved having at least 1 health care visit within the past 5 years and being aged >/= 55 years. RESULTS: The majority of patients were women aged 55 years to 70 years, employed or retired, and who had private health insurance and an average of 2.5 comorbid conditions. The overall percentage of eligible women who were up-to-date for cervical cancer screening was 30%; approximately 27% of women were up-to-date for clinical breast examination, 37% were up-to-date for mammography, and 19% were up-to-date for both mammography and clinical breast examination. Approximately 38% of men and 35% of women were up-to-date for colorectal cancer screening using any test at appropriate screening intervals. In general, having any insurance versus being uninsured was associated with undergoing cancer screening. For each type of screening, patients who had at least 1 health maintenance visit were significantly more likely to be up-to-date compared with those with no health maintenance visits. A significant interaction was found between having health maintenance visits, having any health insurance, and being up-to-date for cancer screening tests. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the percentage of patients who were up-to-date for any cancer screening, especially cervical cancer screening, was found to be very low in rural Oregon. Patients with some form of health insurance were more likely to have had a health maintenance visit within the previous 2 years and to be up-to-date for breast, cervical, and/or colorectal cancer screening.

BACKGROUND: Malignant bowel obstruction affects an estimated 3% to 15% of patients with cancer, with a mean survival of <4 weeks reported in patients with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction. In the current study, the authors assessed predictors of survival and the influence of treatment modality in US patients with cancer who were hospitalized for malignant bowel obstruction. METHODS: All the US cancer patients hospitalized with malignant bowel obstruction in 2006 and 2010 were included. Data were obtained from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample provided by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Malignant bowel obstruction diagnoses and treatment variables were identified using Clinical Classifications Software codes based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Current Procedural Terminology codes. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed with a logistic model, weighted chi-square test, and a generalized linear model. RESULTS: The authors identified 942,014 and 1,103,528 hospitalizations for malignant bowel obstruction in 2006 and 2010, respectively. Medical management, upper gastrointestinal obstruction, health insurance coverage, and obesity were found to be significantly associated with better hospital survival. Multivariate analysis also demonstrated significantly increased odds of death with male sex, advanced age, AJCC stage IV disease, multiple comorbid conditions (except acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), and weight loss. There were no significant differences with stratification based on the location and etiology of the obstruction (primary tumor vs metastatic). CONCLUSIONS: Malignant bowel obstruction is a common cause of death in hospitalized patients with advanced cancer in the United States. The odds of death are especially high in older patients and those with concurrent medical illnesses. Lack of insurance coverage, significant weight loss, and surgical management also appear to be associated with higher mortality in this population.

BACKGROUND: For some patients, positive cancer screening test results can be a stressful experience that can affect future screening compliance and increase the use of health care services unrelated to medically indicated follow-up. METHODS: Among 483,216 individuals aged 50 to 75 years who completed a fecal immunochemical test to screen for colorectal cancer at a large integrated health care setting between 2007 and 2011, the authors evaluated whether a positive test was associated with a net change in outpatient primary care visit use within the year after screening. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate the relationship between test result group and net changes in primary care visits after fecal immunochemical testing. RESULTS: In the year after the fecal immunochemical test, use increased by 0.60 clinic visits for patients with true-positive results. The absolute change in visits was largest (3.00) among individuals with positive test results who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer, but significant small increases also were found for patients treated with polypectomy and who had no neoplasia (0.36) and those with a normal examination and no polypectomy performed (0.17). Groups of patients who demonstrated an increase in net visit use compared with the true-negative group included patients with true-positive results (odds ratio [OR], 1.60; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.54-1.66), and positive groups with a colorectal cancer diagnosis (OR, 7.19; 95% CI, 6.12-8.44), polypectomy/no neoplasia (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.27-1.48), and normal examination/no polypectomy (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.18-1.30). CONCLUSIONS: Given the large size of outreach programs, these small changes can cumulatively generate thousands of excess visits and have a substantial impact on total health care use. Therefore, these changes should be included in colorectal cancer screening cost models and their causes investigated further. Cancer 2017;123:3744-3753. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effectiveness of the NHS Cancer Plan (2000) and subsequent national cancer policy initiatives in improving cancer survival and reducing socioeconomic inequalities in survival in England. DESIGN: Population based cohort study. SETTING: England. POPULATION: More than 3.5 million registered patients aged 15-99 with a diagnosis of one of the 24 most common primary, malignant, invasive neoplasms between 1996 and 2013. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Age standardised net survival estimates by cancer, sex, year, and deprivation group. These estimates were modelled using regression model with splines to explore changes in the cancer survival trends and in the socioeconomic inequalities in survival. RESULTS: One year net survival improved steadily from 1996 for 26 of 41 sex-cancer combinations studied, and only from 2001 or 2006 for four cancers. Trends in survival accelerated after 2006 for five cancers. The deprivation gap observed for all 41 sex-cancer combinations among patients with a diagnosis in 1996 persisted until 2013. However, the gap slightly decreased for six cancers among men for which one year survival was more than 65% in 1996, and for cervical and uterine cancers, for which survival was more than 75% in 1996. The deprivation gap widened notably for brain tumours in men and for lung cancer in women. CONCLUSIONS: Little evidence was found of a direct impact of national cancer strategies on one year survival, and no evidence for a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in cancer survival. These findings emphasise that socioeconomic inequalities in survival remain a major public health problem for a healthcare system founded on equity.

CONTEXT: Assessment of cancer-related fatigue is currently based on patient-reported outcomes. We asked whether objective assessments, such as muscle strength and nutritional markers, can be used as surrogate measures of cancer-related fatigue. OBJECTIVE: We examined the association among three fatigue scales, muscle strength, and nutritional markers in patients with advanced cancer. METHODS: In this prospective study, we enrolled hospitalized cancer patients who had been seen in palliative care consultation at MD Anderson Cancer Center. We assessed fatigue using three fatigue scales-the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI), the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS), and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30)-and determined their association with objective assessments, including handgrip strength, maximal inspiratory pressure, lean body mass, phase angle, and albumin. Spearman's correlation test was used to assess associations. RESULTS: Among 222 patients, the mean age was 55 years; 59% were women. The median overall survival was 106 days. The total BFI score had weak association with handgrip strength (rho = -0.18, P = 0.007) and no association with the remaining objective measures. ESAS fatigue and EORTC fatigue showed similar findings. Total BFI had moderate-to-strong association with ESAS (rho = 0.54, P < 0.0001) and EORTC (rho = 0.60, P < 0.0001) fatigue. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that subjective assessment of fatigue based on patient-reported outcomes correlates only weakly with muscle strength and nutritional markers; thus, patient-reported outcomes remain the gold standard for fatigue assessment.

BACKGROUND: Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a family of emerged pro-inflammatory cytokines. The IL-17A and IL-17F are two important members of IL-17 family. Previous studies have shown that the functional IL-17A G-197A and IL-17F 7488T/C polymorphisms may contribute to susceptibility to cancer but the results were inconclusive. This meta-analysis was performed to determine the exact association between IL-17 polymorphisms and cancer risk. METHODS: Online databases were searched to identify eligible case-control studies. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by fixed-effect models or random-effect models. Publication bias was detected by Egger's test and Begg's test. RESULTS: Nine eligible case-control studies of IL-17A G-197A and seven studies of IL-17F 7488T/C, including 3,181 cases and 4,005 controls, were identified. Pooled analysis suggested the variant IL-17A-197A allele was associated with increased risk cancer (GA/AA vs GG, OR =1.27, 95% CI: 1.15, 1.41, P heterogeneity =0.374; and A vs G, OR =1.30, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.45, P heterogeneity =0.021). For IL-17F 7488T/C, the homozygote 7488CC genotype significantly increased risk of cancer (CC vs TC/TT, OR =1.36, 95% CI: 0.97, 1.91, P heterogeneity =0.875; and CC vs TT, OR =1.39, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.88, P heterogeneity =0.979), especially for gastric cancer. CONCLUSION: The variant IL-17A-197A allele and IL-17F 7488CC genotype were associated with increased risk of cancer, especially for gastric cancer.

AIMS: The reported long waiting times for cancer patients have mostly been related to prognostic outcome and less to patient-related experience to outcome. We assessed waiting times for patients with cancer of the breast, prostate, colon or rectum in Sweden. METHODS: The median time from referral to start of treatment was assessed using data from clinical cancer registers for patients who received curative treatment during 2011, 2012 and 2013. RESULTS: The median overall waiting time in different counties ranged from 7 to 28 days for breast cancer, from 117 to 280 days for prostate cancer, from 27 to 64 days for colon cancer and from 48 to 80 days for rectal cancer. For the entire nation, the median time from referral to start of treatment remained unchanged from 2011 to 2013 for each cancer diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS: Large variations were found in waiting times between different counties in Sweden and between different types of cancer. The long waiting times identified in this study emphasize the need to improve national programmes for more rapid diagnosis and treatment.

PURPOSE: The fat mass- and obesity-associated (FTO) gene on chromosome 16q12.2 shows an intimate association with obesity and body mass index. Recently, research into the FTO gene and its expression product has attracted widespread interest due to the identification of FTO as an N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase. FTO primarily regulates the m6A levels of downstream targets via their 3' untranslated regions. FTO not only plays a critical role in obesity-related diseases but also is involved in the occurrence, development and prognosis of many types of cancer, such as acute myeloid leukaemia, glioblastoma and breast cancer. Currently, studies indicate that FTO is a crucial component of m6A modification, it regulates cancer stem cell function, and promotes the growth, self-renewal and metastasis of cancer cells. In this review, we summarized and analysed the data regarding the structural features and biological functions of FTO as well as its association with different cancers and possible molecular mechanisms. METHODS: We systematically reviewed the related literatures regarding FTO and its demethylation activity in many pathologic and physiological processes, especially in cancer-related diseases based on PubMed databases in this article. RESULTS: Mounting evidence indicated that FTO plays a critical role in occurrence, progression and treatment of various cancers, even acting as a cancer oncogene in acute myeloid leukaemia, research on which is no longer restricted to metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes. CONCLUSION: Considering FTO's critical role in many diseases, FTO may become a new promising target for the diagnosis and treatment of various diseases in the near future, especially for specific types of cancers, such as acute myeloid leukaemia, glioblastoma and breast cancer.

OBJECTIVES: The study objectives were to extend the follow-up of the Ontario uranium miners cohort, one of the largest cohorts of uranium miners with low cumulative exposures, to examine the relationship between radon exposure and lung cancer mortality and, for the first time incidence, and address gaps in the literature, including dose-response relationship between radon exposure and other cancer sites, and non-cancer mortality. METHODS: The cohort of mine and mill workers was created using data from Canada's National Dose Registry and the Ontario Mining Master File. The follow-up for the cohort was recently extended for mortality (1954-2007) and for the first time includes cancer incidence (1969-2005). The Poisson regression was used to estimate relative risks (RR) and excess relative risks (ERR) and their 95% CIs with levels of cumulative radon exposure. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 28 546 male miners with a mean cumulative radon exposure of 21.0 working level months (WLM). An increased risk of lung cancer and a dose-response relationship was observed with cumulative radon exposure. Miners exposed to >100 WLM demonstrated a twofold increase in the risk of lung cancer incidence (RR=1.89, CI 1.43 to 2.50) compared with the non-exposed group, and a linear ERR of 0.64/100 WLM (CI 0.43 to 0.85), with similar results observed for mortality. No association was observed for other cancer sites (stomach, leukaemia, kidney and extrathoracic airways) or non-cancer sites (cardiovascular diseases) with increasing cumulative exposure to radon. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest no increased risk of cancer sites other than lung or non-cancer mortality from relatively low cumulative exposure to radon.

Although metabolic alterations are one of the hallmarks of cancer, there is a lack of understanding of how metabolic landscape is reconstituted according to cancer progression and which genetic alterations underlie its heterogeneity within cancer cells. Here, the configuration of the metabolic landscape according to genetic alteration is examined across 7648 subjects representing 29 cancers. The metabolic landscape and its reconfiguration according to the accumulated mutation maintained characteristics of their tissue of origin. However, there were some common patterns across cancers in terms of the association with cancer progression. Carbohydrate and pyrimidine metabolism showed the highest positive correlation with tumor metabolic burden and they were also common poor prognostic pathways in several cancer types. We additionally examined whether genetic alterations associated with the heterogeneity of metabolic landscape. Genetic alterations associated with each metabolic pathway differed between cancers, however, they were a part of cancer drivers in most cancer types.

Cancer is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity globally. Many prominent cancer-associated molecules have been identified over the recent years which include EGFR, CD44, TGFbRII, HER2, miR-497, NMP22, BTA, Fibrin/FDP etc. These biomarkers are often used for screening, detection, diagnosis, prognosis, prediction and monitoring of cancer development. Phosphatidylserine (PS) is an essential component in all human cells which is present on the inner leaflet of the cell membrane. The oxidative stress causes exposure of PS on the surface of the vascular endothelium in the cancer cells (lung, breast, pancreatic, bladder, skin, brain metastasis, rectal adenocarcinoma etc.) but not on the normal cells. The external PS is regulated by calcium-dependent flippase activity. Cancer cell lines with high surface PS have low flippase activity and high intracellular calcium content. Human Annexin-V, PS targeting antibodies (PGN635 and bavituximab and mch1N11), lysosomal protein, phospholipid Saposin C dioleoylphosphatidylserine (SapC-DOPS), peptide-peptoid hybrid PPS1, PS-binding 14-mer peptide (PSBP-6) and hexapeptide (E3) have been reported to target PS present on cancer cell surface. High expression of CD47 inhibits tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages. The PS cancer biomarker has also been used to target the drugs to cancer cells specifically without affecting other healthy cells. Currently, the fusion protein (FP) consisting of L-methionase linked to human Annexin-V has been reported to target the cancer cells. The FP catalyzes the conversion of non-toxic prodrug selenomethionine into toxic methyl selenol which thus also prevents the methionine (essential amino acid) supplementation to the cancer cells.

Alcohol consumption is an established risk factor, and also a potential prognostic factor, for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (HNSCC). However, little is known about whether the prognostic impact of alcohol consumption differs by treatment method. We evaluated the association between alcohol drinking and survival by treatment method to the primary site in 427 patients with HNSCC treated between 2005 and 2013 at Aichi Cancer Center Central Hospital (Nagoya, Japan). The impact of alcohol on prognosis was measured by multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for established prognostic factors. Among all HNSCC patients, the overall survival rate was significantly poorer with increased levels of alcohol consumption in multivariable analysis (trend P = 0.038). Stratification by treatment method and primary site revealed that the impact of drinking was heterogeneous. Among laryngopharyngeal cancer (laryngeal, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancer) patients receiving radiotherapy (n = 141), a significant dose-response relationship was observed (trend P = 0.034). In contrast, among laryngopharyngeal cancer patients treated with surgery (n = 80), no obvious impact of alcohol was observed. This heterogeneity in the impact of alcohol between surgery and radiotherapy was significant (for interaction, P = 0.048). Furthermore, among patients with oral cavity cancer treated by surgery, a significant impact of drinking on survival was seen with tongue cancer, but not with non-tongue oral cancer. We observed a significant inverse association between alcohol drinking and prognosis among HNSCC patients, and its impact was heterogeneous by treatment method and primary site.

In recent years, there has been a revolutionary expansion in technologic advances and therapeutic innovations in cancer medicine. Cancer diagnostics has begun to move away from a sole dependence on direct tumor tissue biopsy for cancer detection, diagnosis, and treatment monitoring. The need for improvement in molecular cancer diagnostics has never been more important, with not only the advent of cancer genomics and genomics-guided precision medicine but also the recent arrival of cancer immunotherapies. Owing to the practical limitations and risks associated with tissue-based biopsy diagnostics, novel noninvasive cancer diagnostics platforms have continued to evolve and expand in recent years. Examples of these platforms include the liquid biopsy, which is used to interrogate ctDNA or circulating tumor cells, proteomics, metabolomics, and exosomes; the urine biopsy, which is used to assay ctDNAs; saliva and stool biopsies, which are used for molecular genomics assays; and the breath biopsy, which measures volatile organic compounds. These next-generation noninvasive molecular diagnostics assays beyond tissues fundamentally transform the potential utilities of cancer diagnostics to enable repeat, prospective, and serial longitudinal "biopsies" to monitor disease response resistance and progression on therapies. Moreover, they allow continual interrogation and molecular in-depth analysis of the evolving tumor's pan-canceromics under therapeutic stress. These technological and diagnostic advances have already brought about paradigm-changing next-generation cancer therapeutic strategies to enhance overall treatment efficacies. This article reviews the key noninvasive next-generation molecular diagnostics platforms beyond tissues, with emphasis on clinical utilities and applications.

Background and purpose: In cancer patients, an ischemic stroke can be seen as both a direct effect of cancer and a complication of treatment. This condition can negatively affect the follow-up and treatment of these patients. For this research, we aimed to evaluate the clinical features, stroke types and etiological features of ischemic stroke patients with histories of cancer or found to have cancer during the aetiological investigation. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 100 patients (57 males, 43 females) who were hospitalized with acute stroke and determined to have the presence of cancer or a cancer history during the aetiological investigation between 2011 and 2016. All the demographic features, stroke types and localizations, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, Rankin Scale scores, durations of cancer and cancer treatments were recorded. Results: The mean age of the patients was 67.07 +/- 10.9 years old, the median NIHSS score was 5, and the median Rankin Scale score was 4. While 79% of patients had ischemic stroke risk factors, 21% did not. Atherosclerotic stroke was the most common stroke type (49%, n=49) and cryptogenic strokes were detected in 21% (n=21). In addition, 63% of the patients had chronic cancer (later than 6 months), 31% of the patients had recent cancer histories (less than 6 months), and 29% of the patients had metastases. Among all the malignancies, lung cancer (n=23), gastrointestinal cancer (n=20) and gynaecological-breast cancer (n=16) were the three most common. Moreover, 37% of the patients underwent chemotherapy, 29% underwent radiotherapy, and 88% of the patients had Carotid/Vertebral Doppler USG abnormalities. Conclusion: Similar to what is stated in the literature, an atherosclerotic stroke was the most common type of stroke in the cancer patients. Stroke risk factors were not detected in 21% of the patients, and in the majority of the patients, atherosclerotic changes in the carotid artery were observed in the Doppler examinations. In the aetiology and prognosis of ischemic stroke, it is important to keep in mind the existence of cancer in addition to the classical stroke risk factors.

AIMS: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of cancer occurrence on persistence of oral antidiabetic drugs (OAD) in France. METHODS: A retrospective cohort including incident OAD users between 2006 and 2011 was set up using a permanent sample of health insurance beneficiaries (Echantillon Generaliste de Beneficiaires, EGB). A Cox model was used to assess the association between cancer occurrence and OAD persistence. Non-persistence was defined as a gap in OAD treatment coverage between the end of a given prescription and a new one greater than or equal to 90days. Cancer occurrence was studied as a time-dependent variable. RESULTS: The study included 13,943 OAD users. Median follow-up was 760days. After adjustment for age, sex, first OAD used, type of prescriber and polypharmacy, non-persistence risk was higher after a diagnosis of cancer: (HR: 1.93 and IC 95% 1.69; 2.21). Subgroup analyses according to cancer localization found a higher risk of non-persistence for lung cancer (HR: 2.66 and IC 95% 1.68; 4.23) and colorectal cancer (HR: 2.02 and IC 95% 1.40; 2.91). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate there is an association between cancer diagnosis and OAD non-persistence. Additional studies of this type would be useful to evaluate the association between cancer diagnosis and persistence of treatment of other chronic diseases.

BACKGROUND: Advanced imaging and serum biomarkers are commonly used for surveillance in patients with early-stage breast cancer, despite recommendations against this practice. Incentives to perform such low-value testing may be less prominent in integrated health care delivery systems. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate and compare the use of these services within 2 integrated systems: Kaiser Permanente (KP) and Intermountain Healthcare (IH). The authors also sought to distinguish the indication for testing: diagnostic purposes or routine surveillance. METHODS: Patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage 0 to II breast cancer diagnosed between 2009 and 2010 were identified and the use of imaging and biomarker tests over an 18-month period were quantified, starting at 1 year after diagnosis. Chart abstraction was performed on a random sample of patients who received testing to identify the indication for testing. Multivariate regression was used to explore associations with the use of nonrecommended care. RESULTS: A total of 6585 patients were identified; 22% had stage 0 disease, 44% had stage I disease, and 34% had stage II disease. Overall, 24% of patients received at least 1 imaging test (25% at KP vs 22% at IH; P = .009) and 28% of patients received at least 1 biomarker (36% at KP vs 13% at IH; P<.001). Chart abstraction revealed that 84% of imaging tests were performed to evaluate symptoms or signs. Virtually all biomarkers were ordered for routine surveillance. Stage of disease, medical center that provided the services, and provider experience were found to be significantly associated with the use of biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Advanced imaging was most often performed for appropriate indications, but biomarkers were used for nonrecommended surveillance. Distinguishing between inappropriate use for surveillance and appropriate diagnostic testing is essential when evaluating adherence to recommendations.

BACKGROUND: Marital status, income, and education might influence the risk of esophageal and gastric cancer, but the literature is limited. A large study addressing subtypes of these tumors was used to clarify these associations. METHODS: A nationwide, Swedish population-based cohort study from 1991 to 2010 included individuals who were 50 years old or older. Data on exposures, covariates, and outcomes were obtained from well-maintained registers. Four esophagogastric tumor subtypes were analyzed in combination and separately: esophageal adenocarcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, cardia adenocarcinoma, and noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma. Poisson regression was used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Analyses were stratified by sex and adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: Among 4,734,227 participants (60,634,007 person-years), 24,095 developed esophageal or gastric cancer. In comparison with individuals in a long marriage, increased IRRs were found among participants who were in a shorter marriage or were never married, remarried, divorced, or widowed. These associations were indicated for each tumor subtype but were generally stronger for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Higher education and income were associated with decreased IRRs in a seemingly dose-response manner and similarly for each subtype. In comparison with the completion of only primary school, higher tertiary education rendered an IRR of 0.64 (95% CI, 0.60-0.69) for men and an IRR of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.61-0.75) for women. Comparing participants in the highest and lowest income brackets (highest 20% vs lowest 20%) revealed an IRR of 0.74 (95% CI, 0.70-0.79) for men and an IRR of 0.83 (95% CI, 0.76-0.91) for women. CONCLUSIONS: Divorce, widowhood, living alone, low educational attainment, and low income increase the risk of each subtype of esophageal and gastric cancer. These associations require attention when high-risk individuals are being identified. Cancer 2016;122:207-212. (c) 2015 American Cancer Society.

Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer, and the second leading cause of cancer-related death for men in the United States. Despite the approval of several new agents for advanced disease, each of these has prolonged survival by only a few months. Consequently, new therapies are sorely needed. For other cancer types, immunotherapy has demonstrated dramatic and durable treatment responses, causing many to hope that immunotherapies might provide an ideal treatment approach for patients with advanced prostate cancer. However, apart from sipuleucel-T, prostate cancer has been conspicuously absent from the list of malignancies for which immunotherapies have received recent approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. This has left some wondering whether immunotherapy will "work" for this disease. In this review, the authors describe current developments in immunotherapy, including approaches to engage tumor-targeting T cells, disrupt immune regulation, and alter the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The authors then describe the recent application of these approaches to the treatment of prostate cancer. Given the Food and Drug Administration approval of 1 agent, and the finding that several others are in advanced stages of clinical testing, the authors believe that immunotherapies offer real hope to improve patient outcomes for men with prostate cancer, especially as investigators begin to explore rational combinations of immunotherapies and combine these therapies with other conventional therapies.

BACKGROUND: Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by a very high lifetime cancer risk and an early age at diagnosis of a wide cancer spectrum. Precise estimates for the risk of first and subsequent cancers are lacking. METHODS: The National Cancer Institute's Li-Fraumeni Syndrome Study includes families meeting the diagnostic criteria for LFS or Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome, and individuals with a germline TP53 mutation, choroid plexus carcinoma, adrenocortical carcinoma, or >/=3 cancers. Herein, we estimated the cumulative risk and annual hazards for first and second cancers among TP53 mutation carriers (TP53 positive [TP53+]) using MATLAB statistical software. RESULTS: This study evaluated 286 TP53+ individuals from 107 families. The cumulative cancer incidence was 50% by age 31 years among TP53+ females and 46 years among males, and nearly 100% by age 70 years for both sexes. Cancer risk was highest after age 20 years for females, mostly due to breast cancer, whereas among males the risk was higher in childhood and later adulthood. Among females, the cumulative incidence rates by age 70 years for breast cancer, soft tissue sarcoma, brain cancer, and osteosarcoma were 54%, 15%, 6%, and 5%, respectively. Among males, the incidence rates were 22%, 19%, and 11%, respectively, for soft tissue sarcoma, brain cancer, and osteosarcoma. Approximately 49% of those with 1 cancer developed at least another cancer after a median of 10 years. The average age-specific risk of developing a second cancer was comparable to that of developing a first cancer. CONCLUSIONS: The cumulative cancer risk in TP53 + individuals was very high and varied by sex, age, and cancer type. Additional work, including prospective risk estimates, is needed to better inform personalized risk management. Cancer 2016;122:3673-81. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women in the world. Although breast cancer is well treatable at the early stage, patients with distant metastases show a poor prognosis. Data from recent studies using transplantation models indicate that Mint3/APBA3 might promote breast cancer malignancy. However, whether Mint3 indeed contributes to tumor development, progression, or metastasis in vivo remains unclear. To address this, here we examined whether Mint3 depletion affects tumor malignancy in MMTV-PyMT breast cancer model mice. In MMTV-PyMT mice, Mint3 depletion did not affect tumor onset and tumor growth, but attenuated lung metastases. Experimental lung metastasis of breast cancer Met-1 cells derived from MMTV-PyMT mice also decreased in Mint3-depleted mice, indicating that host Mint3 expression affected lung metastasis of MMTV-PyMT-derived breast cancer cells. Further bone marrow transplant experiments revealed that Mint3 in bone marrow-derived cells promoted lung metastasis in MMTV-PyMT mice. Thus, targeting Mint3 in bone marrow-derived cells might be a good strategy for preventing metastasis and improving the prognosis of breast cancer patients.

OBJECTIVE: Ethnic newspapers have the potential to reach and influence various cultural and ethnic subpopulations traditionally underserved in the United States. The current study sought to explore how ethnic news consumption interacts with health motivation to predict cancer prevention behaviors in a sample of Spanish-speaking adults. DESIGN: Participants (N = 100) completed a survey in Spanish, with items measuring demographics, acculturation, health literacy, health motivation, ethnic newspaper consumption (for two papers: La Viva and La Raza), and cancer prevention behaviors. RESULTS: Results indicated consumption of ethnic newspapers correlated positively to acculturation, and cancer screening utilization. In hierarchical regression analyses, the interaction of consumption of an ethnic newspaper (La Raza) and health motivation predicted two of the six prevention behaviors assessed: avoidance of fatty foods and screening behavior. CONCLUSION: The study provides evidence that consumption of Spanish-language newspapers enhances the likelihood that individuals with high levels of health motivation will engage in healthy behaviors. This finding highlights the utility of utilizing Spanish-language newspapers to reach underserved populations.

BACKGROUND: Not-infrequently patients with head and neck cancer are also diagnosed with synchronous lung cancer or metachronous primary lung cancer, which complicates the treatment decisions and prognosis. METHODS: Patients were identified from a database of patients with head and neck cancer with second primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). RESULTS: Thirty-four eligible patients (15 with synchronous lung cancer and 19 with metachronous lung cancer) were identified. Thirteen of 15 patients with synchronous lung cancer received curative intent treatment for head and neck cancer first. Six of 15 patients were in complete remission, 5 of 15 patients had died, and 4 were alive with progressive disease. Median time between 2 diagnoses was 47 months in the metachronous lung cancer group. Twelve patients had died, 3 were alive with disease, and 4 were lost to follow-up. Median survival from the time of lung cancer diagnosis was 13 months with a trend to better survival with synchronous lung cancer (15 vs 11 months; p = .11). CONCLUSION: Aggressive multidisciplinary management of second primary lung malignancies in patients with head and neck cancer can result in respectable long-term disease control particularly in patients with synchronous lung cancer.

Quadruple synchronous primary neoplasms are exceedingly rare with only one case reported in the English literature. We herein report a case of synchronous quadruple primary neoplasms in a 70-year-old Arabic male with a history of prostate cancer who presented to our hospital for work-up of a brain mass found at an outside hospital. Subsequent (18)Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography demonstrated a 5.9-cm temporoparietal mass and three additional lesions, each with increased maximum standardized uptake value (SUV(max)). Histologic examination, immunohistochemistry and cytogenetic analyses of the lesional tissue revealed four primary neoplastic lesions: primary glioblastoma, inguinal schwannoma, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumor of the terminal ileum and an appendiceal sessile serrated adenoma/polyp. This case is unique among previous reports as our patient presented with four primary neoplasms synchronously. To the best of our knowledge, this combination of synchronous multiple primary neoplasms has not been reported in the English literature.

Background: Numerous studies have reported the prognostic significance of serum apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) in various cancers, but the results have been inconsistent. The current meta-analysis was performed to investigate the association between ApoA-I level and prognosis in human malignancies. Methods: A literature search was performed using the electronic platforms of the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase, Wanfang, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases to obtain eligible articles published up to May 20, 2018. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated to assess the prognostic values of the ApoA-I level in cancers using STATA 12.0 software. Results: A total of 14 studies involving 9295 patients were included. The results indicated that low ApoA-I level was significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) (HR = 0.52, 95% CI: 0.44-0.61). Significant relationships between the ApoA-I level and OS were specifically detected in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC, HR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.54-0.73), colorectal cancer (CRC, HR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.19-0.76), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, HR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.27-0.65). The subgroup analyses for OS also further confirmed the prognostic significance of the ApoA-I level in cancers. Moreover, lower Apo A-I was associated with unfavorable cancer-specific survival (CSS, HR: 0.47, 95% CI: 0.19-0.76) in cancers, and low ApoA-I level was clearly associated with inferior total time to recurrence (TTR, HR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.29-0.58) in HCC, poorer locoregional recurrence-free survival (LRFS) and distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) (HR: 0.58, 95% CI: 0.42-0.74 for LRFS; HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.41-0.89 for DMFS) in NPC, and shorter disease-free survival (DFS, HR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.43-0.84) in cancers. Conclusions. Low ApoA-I level might be an unfavorable prognostic factor in multiple malignancies, and serum ApoA-I could serve as a noninvasive marker to predict cancer prognosis.

BACKGROUND: The risk of a second primary cancer has increased along with the increasing life expectancies of colorectal cancer survivors. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the incidence rate and risk factors of breast and gynecological (ovarian, uterine cervix/corpus) cancers among female colorectal cancer survivors. DESIGN: This is a retrospective population-based cohort study. SETTINGS: This study used data from the National Health Insurance Corporation of Korea. PATIENTS: Each patient with colorectal cancer diagnosed from 2007 to 2012 was followed until 2015 and compared with age-matched women without colorectal cancer at a 1:5 ratio. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was de novo breast/gynecological cancer. Patients with available medical checkup data were included in an additional analysis. RESULTS: We analyzed 56,682 patients with colorectal cancer and 288,119 age-matched noncolorectal cancer controls. The risk of breast/gynecological cancer was higher among patients with colorectal cancer than among controls (HR, 2.91; p < 0.001). The association with colorectal cancer was the highest for ovarian cancer (HR, 6.72), followed by uterine corpus cancer (HR, 3.99), cervical cancer (HR, 2.82), and breast cancer (HR, 1.85). This association remained consistent in the subgroup analysis of medical checkup data (14,190 patients with colorectal cancer, 71,933 controls). Among patients with colorectal cancer, those aged <55 years had a higher risk of breast/gynecological cancers than those aged >55 years (HR, 3.51 vs 2.59), and those with dyslipidemia had a higher risk of breast cancer than those without dyslipidemia (HR, 2.66 vs 2.06). LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective, population-based study. A prospectively designed study is needed to validate our conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the general population, patients with colorectal cancer carry a higher risk of developing secondary breast, ovarian, and uterine cancers.

BACKGROUND: Guidelines for the treatment of nonmetastatic inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) using trimodality therapy (TT) (chemotherapy, surgery, and radiotherapy) have remained largely unchanged since 2000. However, many patients with nonmetastatic IBC do not receive TT. It is unknown how patient-level (PL) and facility-level (FL) factors contribute to TT use. METHODS: Using the National Cancer Data Base, patients with nonmetastatic IBC who underwent locoregional treatment from 2003 through 2011 were identified. The authors correlated PL factors, including demographic and tumor characteristics, with TT use. An observed-to-expected ratio for the number of patients treated with TT was calculated for each hospital by adjusting for significant PL factors. Hierarchical mixed effects models were used to assess the percentage of variation in TT use attributable to PL and FL factors, respectively. RESULTS: Of the 542 hospitals examined, 55 (10.1%) and 24 (4.4%), respectively, were identified as significantly low and high outliers for TT use (P<.05). The percentage of the total variance in the use of TT attributable to the facility (11%) was nearly triple the variance attributable to the measured PL factors (3.4%). The nomogram generated from multivariate logistic regression of PL factors only allows a facility to assess TT use given their PL data. CONCLUSIONS: FL factors rather than PL factors appear to contribute disproportionately to the underuse of TT in patients with nonmetastatic IBC. To improve treatment guideline adherence for patients with nonmetastatic IBC, it is critical to identify the specific FL factors associated with TT underuse. More organized FL intervention is required to train physicians and to build multidisciplinary teams. Cancer 2017;123:2618-25. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

PURPOSE: The gut microbiome plays a critical role in maintaining children's health and in preventing and treating children's disease. Current application of the gut microbiome in childhood cancer is still lacking. This study aimed to systematically review the following: (1) alternations in the gut microbiome throughout cancer treatment trajectories in children, (2) the associations between the gut microbiome and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and psychoneurological symptoms (PNS), and (3) the efficacy of therapeutic interventions in the gut microbiome in children with cancer. METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the American Society of Clinical Oncology abstract were searched. Eligible studies included all study types in which the gut microbiome was primarily reported in children with cancer. The Mixed Methods Assessment Tool was used to evaluate the methodology quality of included studies. Seven studies met our eligibility criteria, including two cohort studies, two case-control studies, and three randomized controlled trails. RESULTS: The findings showed that the diversity estimates of the gut microbiome in children with cancer were lower than those of healthy controls both pre- and post-treatment. Children with cancer showed a significantly lower relative abundance of healthy gut microbiome (e.g., Clostridium XIVa and Bifidobacterium) during and after cancer treatment. No adequate literature was identified to support the associations between dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and GI symptoms/PNS. The use of prebiotics (fructooligosaccharides) and probiotics (Bifidobacterium or Lactobacilli) appears to improve the microenvironment of the gut around 1 month (4-5 weeks) during chemotherapy rather than at the beginning of treatment. Data also suggest that both prebiotic and probiotic interventions decrease clinical side effects (e.g., infection and morbidity risk) in children with cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the evidence that dysbiosis of the gut microbiome can be improved using prebiotic and probiotic supplementations in children with cancer. More well-designed experimental studies are needed to confirm this conclusion. Further studies are needed to examine the associations between the gut microbiome and GI symptoms/PNS in childhood cancer.

PURPOSE: With increasing cancer care costs and greater patient cost-sharing in the USA, understanding access to medical care among cancer survivors is imperative. This study aims to identify financial, psychosocial, and cancer-related barriers to the receipt of medical care, tests, or treatments deemed necessary by the doctor or patient for cancer among cancer survivors age < 65 years. METHODS: We used data on 4321 cancer survivors aged 18-64 years who completed the 2012 LIVESTRONG Survey. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors associated with the receipt of necessary medical care, including sociodemographic, financial hardship, debt amount, caregiver status, and cancer-related variables. RESULTS: Approximately 28% of cancer survivors were within 1 year, and 43% between 1 and 5 years, since their last treatment at the time of survey. Nearly 9% of cancer survivors reported not receiving necessary medical care. Compared to survivors without financial hardship, the likelihood of not receiving necessary medical care significantly increased as the amount of debt increased among those with financial hardship (RRFinancial hardship w/< $10,000 debt = 1.94, 95% CI 1.55-2.42, and RR RRFinancial hardship w/>/= $10,000 debt = 3.41, 95% CI 2.69-4.33, p < 0.001). Survivors who reported lack of a caregiver, being uninsured, and not receiving help understanding medical bills were significantly more likely to not receive necessary medical care. CONCLUSION: We identified key financial and insurance risk factors that may serve as significant barriers to the receipt of necessary medical care among cancer survivors age < 65 in the USA IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: The majority of cancer survivors reported receiving medical care either they or their doctors deemed necessary. However, identifying potentially modifiable barriers to receipt of necessary medical cancer care among cancer survivors age < 65 is imperative for developing interventions to ensure equitable access to care and reducing cancer disparities.

BACKGROUND: Older adults with cancer are vulnerable to functional decline, which places greater onus on caregivers. Few studies have prospectively examined burden in caregivers of older cancer patients. The objective of this study was to determine the factors associated with high caregiver burden. METHODS: In total, 100 caregivers of patients aged >/=65 years with cancer, who were recruited at a single institution, completed questionnaires gauging their perception of the patient's physical, emotional, and social health. The association between these items, cancer-related factors, sociodemographic factors, and caregiver burden (measured using the Caregiver Strain Index [CSI]) was determined through multivariate analysis. RESULTS: The median patient age was 70 years (range, 65-91 years), 70% of patients had advanced disease, and 98% were receiving treatment. Caregivers were mostly women (73%), spouses (68%), and lived with the patient (79%). The median amount of care provided was 10 hours per week. The mean CSI score (+/- standard deviation) was 3.1 +/- 3.2. Most caregivers (75%) reported some burden, with 15% reporting high caregiver burden (CSI score, >/=7). In multivariate analysis, employed caregivers (odds ratio, 4.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-18.4; P = .04) and those caring for patients who required more help with instrumental activities of daily living (Older Americans Resources and Services-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living score, <12 of a possible 14; odds ratio, 12.4; 95% confidence interval, 2.4-62.5; P < .001) were more likely to experience high caregiver burden (CSI score, >/=7). CONCLUSIONS: Caregiver burden is common in those who care for older cancer patients. High burden is more likely in employed caregivers and in those who care for patients who require increased functional assistance. Further studies are needed to determine the unique challenges experienced by caregivers of older adults with cancer and potential interventions to alleviate burden in these caregivers.

OBJECTIVES: Researchers have advocated for an increased awareness of occult cancer among herpes zoster patients, but there are no systematic reviews to support these claims. We therefore conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of evidence on zoster and risk of occult cancer. METHODS: Through February 18, 2016, we searched PubMed, EMBASE and references of relevant papers for studies on zoster and risk of any cancer. One author screened retrieved papers by title and abstract; included papers were reviewed by two authors for eligibility, data extraction, and potential biases. Despite statistical heterogeneity, associations were consistently in the same direction and we therefore computed pooled relative risks using random-effects models. RESULTS: We identified 46 eligible studies, 10 of which considered all cancer types combined. The pooled relative risk for any cancer was 1.42 (95% confidence interval: 1.18, 1.71) overall and 1.83 (95% confidence interval: 1.17, 2.87) at one year after zoster. Considering cancer subtypes, the highest estimates were generally reported for occult hematological cancer. The absolute risk of any cancer at one year after presentation with zoster was 0.7-1.8%. CONCLUSION: This study supports an association between zoster and occult cancer, but the low absolute risk of cancer limits the clinical implications.

The present study aimed to compare cancer incidence and trends in survival for children diagnosed in Japan and England, using population-based cancer registry data. The analysis was based on 5192 children with cancer (age 0-14 years) from 6 prefectural cancer registries in Japan and 21 295 children diagnosed in England during 1993-2010. Differences in incidence rates between the 2 countries were measured with Poisson regression models. Overall survival was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Incidence rates for Hodgkin lymphoma, renal tumors and Ewing sarcomas in England were more than twice as high as those in Japan. Incidence of germ cell tumors, hepatic tumors, neuroblastoma and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) was higher in Japan than in England. Incidence of all cancers combined decreased in Japan throughout the period 1993 to 2010, which was mainly explained by a decrease in registration of neuroblastoma in infants. For many cancers, 5-year survival improved in both countries. The improvement in survival in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was particularly dramatic in both countries. However, 5-year survival remained less than 80% in 2005-2008 in both countries for AML, brain tumors, soft tissue sarcomas, malignant bone tumors and neuroblastoma (age 1-14 years). There were significant differences in incidence of several cancers between countries, suggesting variation in genetic susceptibility and possibly environmental factors. The decrease in incidence for all cancers combined in Japan was related to the cessation of the national screening program for neuroblastoma. The large improvement in survival in CML coincided with the introduction of effective therapy (imatinib).

NHERF1 (Na(+)/H(+) exchanger regulatory factor) is a scaffolding protein, consists of two tandem PDZ domains linked to a carboxyl-terminal ezrin-binding region. NHERF1 recruits macromolecular complexes at the apical membrane of epithelial cells in many epithelial tissues. It is involved in trafficking and regulation of transmembrane ion transporters and G protein-coupled receptors. Further, NHERF1 also linked other molecules involved in cell growth and cancer progression, such as PDGFR, PTEN, beta-catenin, EGFR and HER2/neu. In this review, we focus on the role of NHERF1 during cancer development. Evidences of its involvement in cancer development are present in hepatocellular carcinoma, schwannoma, glioblastoma, colorectal cancer and particularly in breast cancer. Recent findings obtained from our laboratory show that cytoplasmic NHERF1 expression increases gradually in breast cancer during carcinogenesis, and its overexpression is associated with aggressive clinical parameters, unfavourable prognosis, and increased tumor hypoxia. Interestingly, also nuclear NHERF1 expression seems to play a role both in carcinogenesis and progression of colorectal cancer. These data suggest that NHERF1 could be a new biomarker of advanced malignancies.

There has been substantial enthusiasm recently regarding the potential role of vitamin D in the primary and secondary prevention of cancer. Laboratory studies demonstrate a range of anticarcinogenic effects for vitamin D compounds, but human studies have yielded little consistent evidence supporting a protective association. Higher circulating levels of vitamin D (i.e., 25-hydroxyvitamin D or 25(OH)D) appear to be associated with reduced risk of colorectal and bladder malignancies, but higher risk of prostate and possibly pancreatic cancers, with no clear association for most other organ sites examined. Despite there being no official institutional recommendations regarding the use of vitamin D supplements for cancer prevention, screenings for vitamin D deficiency and vitamin D supplement use have increased substantially over the past decade. These widespread practices demonstrate that population sociobehavioral changes are often adopted before scientifically well-informed policies and recommendations are available. This review critically examines the currently available epidemiologic literature regarding the associations between circulating 25(OH)D, vitamin D supplementation, and vitamin D-related genetic variation and cancer risk and mortality, with a particular emphasis on prospective studies. We identify several important gaps in our scientific knowledge that should be addressed in order to provide sufficient reproducible data to inform evidence-based recommendations related to optimal 25(OH)D concentrations (and any role for vitamin D supplementation) for the primary and secondary prevention of cancer. With few exceptions, such recommendations cannot be made at this time.

Objective: To analyze the relationship between the breast cancer molecular classification and the prognosis of patients underwent breast-conserving therapy and to discuss the safety of the breast conserving surgery from the choice of operation in terms of breast cancer molecular classification. Methods: Clinical data of 618 patients with breast-conserving therapy in Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital from August 2005 to August 2010 were analyzed retrospectively. According to the molecular classification when breast cancer was diagnosed, patients were subdivided into five groups, including Luminal A, Luminal B1, Luminal B2, HER-2-positive and Triple-negative. Clinicopathological characteristics and prognosis were compared among five groups and the influencing factors of local recurrence, distant metastasis and overall survival were analyzed. Results: Among 618 patients, there were 148 cases Luminal A, 231 cases Luminal B1, 63 cases Luminal B2, 40 cases HER-2-positive and 136 cases Triple-negative. The age, family history, TNM stage, calcification, histological grade, pathological type and response to endocrine therapy of these 5 molecular types of breast cancer patients were significantly different (all P<0.05). The 5-year local regional recurrence-free survival rates of Luminal A, Luminal B1, Luminal B2, HER-2-positive and Triple-negative were 99.3%, 98.7%, 98.4%, 94.9% and 95.9%, respectively, without significant differences (P=0.104). The 5-year distant metastasis-free survival rates of these 5 types were 97.3%, 95.7%, 93.7%, 87.5% and 91.4%, respectively, with significant differences (P=0.013). Moreover, the 5-year overall survival rates of these 5 types were 98.6%, 97.8%, 98.4%, 92.5% and 95.6%, respectively, without significant differences (P=0.153). Multifactor analysis showed that radiotherapy (HR=0.036, P=0.049) and the number of lymph node metastases (HR=10.72, P=0.004) were independent factors of local recurrence of breast cancer patients underwent breast-conserving therapy. The age (HR=0.369, P=0.046), status of surgical margin (HR=5.486, P=0.007), number of lymph node metastases (HR=2.882, P=0.023) and molecular typing (HR=5.191, P=0.008) were independent factors of distant metastasis of above breast cancer patients. None of the factors were found to be independent factors of the overall survival of these breast cancer patients. Conclusions: Breast conserving therapy does not increase the risks of local recurrence and death of HER-2-positive and Triple-negative breast cancer patients. Therefore, breast conserving therapy can be accepted by patients with HER-2-positive and Triple-negative breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Cancer Patient Pathways (CPPs) were introduced in 2000-2015 in several European countries, including Denmark, to reduce the time to diagnosis and treatment initiation and ultimately improve patient survival. Yet, the prognostic consequences of implementing CPPs remain unknown for symptomatic cancer patients diagnosed through primary care. We aimed to compare survival and mortality among symptomatic patients diagnosed through a primary care route before, during and after the CPP implementation in Denmark. METHODS: Based on data from the Danish Cancer in Primary Care (CaP) Cohort, we compared one- and three-year standardised relative survival (RS) and excess hazard ratios (EHRs) before, during and after CPP implementation for seven types of cancer and all combined (n = 7725) by using life-table estimation and Poisson regression. RS estimates were standardised according to the International Cancer Survival Standard (ICSS) weights. In addition, we compared RS and EHRs for CPP and non-CPP referred patients to consider potential issues of confounding by indication. RESULTS: In total, 7725 cases were analysed: 1202 before, 4187 during and 2336 after CPP implementation. For all cancers combined, the RS3years rose from 45% (95% confidence interval (CI): 42;47) before to 54% (95% CI: 52;56) after CPP implementation. The excess mortality was higher before than after CPP implementation (EHR3years before vs. after CPP = 1.35 (95% CI: 1.21;1.51)). When comparing CPP against non-CPP referred patients, we found no statistically significant differences in RS, but we found lower excess mortality among the CPP referred (EHR1year CPP vs. non-CPP = 0.86 (95% CI: 0.73;1.01)). CONCLUSION: We found higher relative survival and lower mortality among symptomatic cancer patients diagnosed through primary care after the implementation of CPPs in Denmark. The observed changes in cancer prognosis could be the intended consequences of finding and treating cancer at an early stage, but they may also reflect lead-time bias and selection bias. The finding of a lower excess mortality among CPP referred compared to non-CPP referred patients indicates that CPPs may have improved the cancer prognosis independently.

OBJECTIVE: The treatment policy of colorectal cancer in elderly patients is controversial due to a lack of specific guidelines. To clarify the present management of colorectal cancer for aged patients, a questionnaire survey was conducted by the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum. METHODS: Questionnaire forms were sent to the 430 member institutions of the Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum. RESULTS: The response rate of the surgical department to the questionnaire was 39%. Performance status was used for preoperative assessments, and electrocardiogram and ultrasonic cardiograms were conducted for cardiovascular evaluations in many institutions. The same extent of surgical procedures was often adopted for elderly and younger patients, and the frequency of a laparoscopic procedure was the same regardless of a patient's age. A simultaneous hepatectomy for hepatic metastasis was considered in one-third of institutions. In many institutions, intersphincteric resection for patients with possible sphincter-saving surgery was not considered for elderly patients with low rectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Japanese Society for Cancer of the Colon and Rectum member institutions often used the same surgical treatment strategies for both elderly and younger patients with the exception of performing intersphincteric resection.

BACKGROUND: Although birthplace data are routinely collected in the participating Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries, such data are missing in a nonrandom manner for a large percentage of cases. This hinders analysis of nativity-related cancer disparities. In the current study, the authors evaluated multiple imputation of nativity status among Hispanic patients diagnosed with cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer and demonstrated the effect of multiple imputation on apparent nativity disparities in survival. METHODS: Multiple imputation by logistic regression was used to generate nativity values (US-born vs foreign-born) using a priori-defined variables. The accuracy of the method was evaluated among a subset of cases. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to illustrate the effect of imputation by comparing survival among US-born and foreign-born Hispanics, with and without imputation of nativity. RESULTS: Birthplace was missing for 31%, 49%, and 39%, respectively, of cases of cervical, prostate, and colorectal cancer. The sensitivity of the imputation strategy for detecting foreign-born status was >/=90% and the specificity was >/=86%. The agreement between the true and imputed values was >/=0.80 and the misclassification error was </=10%. Kaplan-Meier survival curves indicated different associations between nativity and survival when nativity was imputed versus when cases with missing birthplace were omitted from the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple imputation using variables available in the SEER data file can be used to accurately detect foreign-born status. This simple strategy may help researchers to disaggregate analyses by nativity and uncover important nativity disparities in regard to cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survival.

BACKGROUND: A number of studies have investigated the association between androgenic alopecia (AGA) and cancer risk, but they have yielded inconsistent results. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore this controversial subject. METHODS: A literature database search was performed according to predefined criteria. An odds ratio (OR) or a hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) was retained to evaluate the relationship between the incidence of cancer or cancer-specific mortality and categories of AGA. Then a pooled OR or HR was derived. RESULTS: The pooled results showed that no specific degree of baldness had an influence on the incidence of cancer or cancer-specific mortality. However, AGA, especially frontal baldness, with the incidence of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) (OR = 0.69; 95% CI = 0.58-0.83). A significant increase of risk was observed in relation to high grade prostate cancer (PC) (OR = 1.42; 95% CI 1.02-1.99) and vertex with/without frontal baldness was associated with PC risk. CONCLUSIONS: The study results supported the hypothesis that AGA is negatively associated with TGCT risk and suggested an overlapping pathophysiological mechanism between them, while the viewpoint that AGA can be used as a phenotypic marker for PC risk was poorly supported.

OBJECTIVE: Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of veliparib combined with carboplatin and gemcitabine in patients with advanced ovarian cancer and other nonhematologic malignancies. METHODS: In this phase I study, patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors and </=2 prior chemotherapy regimens received veliparib combined with carboplatin area under the curve (AUC) 4 on day 1 and gemcitabine 800mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle for maximum 10cycles, followed by optional veliparib maintenance therapy. Veliparib dosing commenced twice-daily (BID) continuously on day 1 of cycle 2; granulocyte colony-stimulating factor was permitted. Dose escalation used a Bayesian continual reassessment method. Safety, tolerability, and efficacy were evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were enrolled (ovarian cancer, n=54; breast cancer, n=12). Thirty-six patients with ovarian cancer (67%) had known germline BRCA mutations. Most common treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs; >/=60%) were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, nausea, and anemia. Most common grade 3/4 TRAEs (>/=40%) were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Dose-limiting toxicities were thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. The MTD/RP2D was established at veliparib 250mg with carboplatin AUC 4 plus gemcitabine 800mg/m(2). Responses were observed in 69% of patients with BRCA-deficient ovarian cancer (45% partial, 24% complete responses). Five patients remained on veliparib (80-310mg BID) for >34cycles. CONCLUSIONS: Veliparib plus carboplatin/gemcitabine is tolerated, with a safety profile similar to carboplatin and gemcitabine alone. Combination therapy demonstrated promising preliminary antitumor activity in platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer patients with germline BRCA mutations. Trial registration ID: NCT01063816.

INTRODUCTION: With the aim of providing cancer control indicators, this work presents cancer survival in adult (>/=15 years) patients in Spain diagnosed during the period 2000-2007 from Spanish cancer registries participating in the EUROCARE project. METHODS: Cancer cases from nine Spanish population-based cancer registries were included and analysed as a whole. All primary malignant neoplasms diagnosed in adult patients were eligible for the analysis. Cancer patients were followed until 31 December 2008. For each type of cancer, 1-, 3- and 5-year observed and relative survival were estimated by sex, age and years from diagnosis. Furthermore, age-standardized 5-year relative survival for the period 2000-2007 has been compared with that of the period 1995-1999. RESULTS: Skin melanoma (84.6 95% CI 83.0-86.2), prostate (84.6% 95% CI 83.6-85.6) and thyroid (84.2% CI 95% 82.0-86.6) cancers showed the highest 5-year relative survival, whereas the worst prognosis was observed in pancreatic (6% 95% CI 5.1-7.0) and oesophageal (9.4% 95% CI 7.9-11.1) cancers. Overall, survival is higher in women (58.0%) than in men (48.9%). The absolute difference in relative survival between 2000-2007 and 1995-1999 was positive for all cancers as a whole (+4.8% in men, +1.6% in women) and for most types of tumours. Survival increased significantly for chronic myeloid leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and rectum cancer in both sexes, and for acute lymphoid leukaemia, prostate, liver and colon cancers in men and Hodgkin's lymphoma and breast cancer in women. Survival patterns by age were similar in Europe and Spain. A decline in survival by age was observed in all tumours, being more pronounced for ovarian, corpus uteri, prostate and urinary bladder and less for head and neck and rectum cancers. CONCLUSION: High variability and differences have been observed in survival among adults in Spain according to the type of cancer diagnosed, from above 84% to below 10%, reflecting high heterogeneity. The differences in prognosis by age, sex and period of diagnosis reveal opportunities for improving cancer care in Spain.

OBJECTIVE: Prevalence is a statistic of primary interest in public health. In the absence of good follow-up facilities, it is often difficult to assess the complete prevalence of cancer for a given registry area. An attempt is made to arrive at the complete prevalence including limited duration prevalence with respect of selected sites of cancer for India by fitting appropriate models to 1, 3 and 5 year cancer survival data available for selected registries of India. METHODOLOGY: Cancer survival data, available for the registries of Bhopal, Chennai, Karunagappally, and Mumbai was pooled to generate survival for the selected cancer sites. With the available data on survival for 1, 3 and 5 years, a model was fitted and the survival curve was extended beyond 5 years (up to 30 years) for each of the selected sites. This helped in generation of survival proportions by single year and thereby survival of cancer cases. With the help of estimated survived cases available year wise and the incidence, the prevalence figures were arrived for selected cancer sites and for selected periods. In our previous paper, we have dealt with the cancer sites of breast, cervix, ovary, lung, stomach and mouth (Takiar and Jayant, 2013). RESULTS: The prevalence to incidence ratio (PI ratio) was calculated for 30 years duration for all the selected cancer sites using the model approach showing that from the knowledge of incidence and P/I ratio, the prevalence can be calculated. The validity of the approach was shown in our previous paper (Takiar and Jayant, 2013). The P/I ratios for the cancer sites of lip, tongue, oral cavity, hypopharynx, oesophagus, larynx, nhl, colon, prostate, lymphoid leukemia, myeloid leukemia were observed to be 10.26, 4.15, 5.89, 2.81, 1.87, 5.43, 5.48, 5.24, 4.61, 3.42 and 2.65, respectively. CONCLUSION: Cancer prevalence can be readily estimated with use of survival and incidence data.

BACKGROUND: Transplant recipients have an elevated risk of cancer because of immunosuppressive medications used to prevent organ rejection, but to the authors' knowledge no study to date has comprehensively examined associations between transplantation status and mortality after a cancer diagnosis. METHODS: The authors assessed cases in the US general population (N=7,147,476) for 16 different cancer types as ascertained from 11 cancer registries. The presence of a solid organ transplant prior to diagnosis (N=11,416 cancer cases) was identified through linkage with the national transplantation registry (1987-2014). Cox models were used to examine the association between transplantation status and cancer-specific mortality, adjusting for demographic characteristics and cancer stage. RESULTS: For the majority of cancers, cancer-specific mortality was higher in transplant recipients compared with other patients with cancer. The increase was particularly pronounced for melanoma (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.59; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.18-3.00) and cancers of the breast (aHR, 1.88; 95% CI, 1.61-2.19), bladder (aHR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.58-2.17), and colorectum (aHR, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.60-1.96), but it also was increased for cancers of the oral cavity/pharynx, stomach, pancreas, kidney, and lung as well as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (aHR range, 1.21-1.47). Associations remained significant after adjustment for first-course cancer treatment and generally were stronger among patients with local-stage cancers for whom potentially curative treatment was provided, including patients with melanoma (aHR, 3.82; 95% CI, 2.94-4.97) and cancers of the colorectum (aHR, 2.77; 95% CI, 2.07-3.70), breast (aHR, 2.08; 95% CI, 1.50-2.88), and prostate (aHR, 1.60; 95% CI, 1.12-2.29), despite the lack of an association for prostate cancer overall. CONCLUSIONS: For multiple cancer types, transplant recipients with cancer appear to have an elevated risk of dying of their cancer, even after adjustment for stage and treatment, which may be due to impaired immunity.

BACKGROUND: Cancer incidence in exposed rescue/recovery workers (RRWs) and civilians (non-RRWs) was previously reported through 2008. METHODS: We studied occurrence of first primary cancer among World Trade Center Health Registry enrollees through 2011 using adjusted standardized incidence ratios (SIRs), and the WTC-exposure-cancer association, using Cox proportional hazards models. RESULTS: All-cancer SIR was 1.11 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.20) in RRWs, and 1.08 (95% CI 1.02-1.15) in non-RRWs. Prostate cancer and skin melanoma were significantly elevated in both populations. Thyroid cancer was significantly elevated only in RRWs while breast cancer and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were significantly elevated only in non-RRWs. There was a significant exposure dose-response for bladder cancer among RRWs, and for skin melanoma among non-RRWs. CONCLUSIONS: We observed excesses of total and specific cancers in both populations, although the strength of the evidence for causal relationships to WTC exposures is somewhat limited. Continued monitoring of this population is indicated. Am. J. Ind. Med. 59:709-721, 2016. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

An association between coffee consumption and cancer has long been investigated. Coffee consumption among Norwegian women is high, thus this is a favorable population in which to study the impact of coffee on cancer incidence. Information on coffee consumption was collected from 91,767 women at baseline in the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study. These information were applied until follow-up information on coffee consumption, collected 6-8 years after baseline, became available. Multiple imputation was performed as a method for dealing with missing data. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) for breast, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancer, as well as cancer at any site. We observed a 17 % reduced risk of colorectal cancer (HR = 0.83, 95 % CI 0.70-0.98, p trend across categories of consumption = 0.10) and a 9 % reduced risk of cancer at any site (HR = 0.91, 95 % CI 0.86-0.97, p trend = 0.03) in women who drank more than 3 and up to 7 cups/day, compared to women who drank </=1 cup/day. A significantly increased risk of lung cancer was observed with a heavy coffee consumption (>7 vs. </=1 cup/day HR = 2.01, 95 % CI 1.47-2.75, p trend < 0.001). This was most likely caused by residual confounding due to smoking, as no statistically significant association was observed in never smokers (>5 vs. </=1 cup/day HR = 1.42, 95 % CI 0.44-4.57, p trend = 0.30). No significant association was found between coffee consumption and the risk of breast or ovarian cancer. In this study, coffee consumption was associated with a modest reduced risk of cancer at any site. Residual confounding due to smoking may have contributed to the positive association between high coffee consumption and the risk of lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Composite measures are useful for distilling quality data into summary scores; yet, there has been limited use of composite measures for cancer care. OBJECTIVE: Compare multiple approaches for generating cancer care composite measures and evaluate how well composite measures summarize dimensions of cancer care and predict survival. STUDY DESIGN: We computed hospital-level rates for 13 colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer process measures in 59 Veterans Affairs hospitals. We computed 4 empirical-factor (based on an exploratory factor analysis), 3 cancer-specific (colorectal, lung, prostate care), and 3 care modality-specific (diagnosis/evaluation, surgical, nonsurgical treatments) composite measures. We assessed correlations among all composite measures and estimated all-cause survival for colon, rectal, non-small cell lung, and small cell lung cancers as a function of composite scores, adjusting for patient characteristics. RESULTS: Four factors emerged from the factor analysis: nonsurgical treatment, surgical treatment, colorectal early diagnosis, and prostate treatment. We observed strong correlations (r) among composite measures comprised of similar process measures (r=0.58-1.00, P<0.0001), but not among composite measures reflecting different care dimensions. Composite measures were rarely associated with survival. CONCLUSIONS: The empirical-factor domains grouped measures variously by cancer type and care modality. The evidence did not support any single approach for generating cancer care composite measures. Weak associations across different care domains suggest that low-quality and high-quality cancer care delivery may coexist within Veterans Affairs hospitals.

BACKGROUND: Routine cancer screening for cervical, breast, and colorectal cancers reduces disease-associated morbidity and mortality through early detection and treatment. Lack of access to health care is a major barrier to screening in immigrant populations. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to characterize compliance with national cancer screening guidelines and to assess predictors of screening compliance among women residing in each of two distinct immigrant communities in Miami-Dade County--Little Haiti (Haitian) and Hialeah (Cuban). METHODS: Through a collaborative community-based participatory research (CBPR) initiative, researchers, key community stakeholders, and community members developed the study design. Data were collected from a total of 234 women via a rapid assessment survey administered by community health workers (CHWs). RESULTS: Compliance with national screening guidelines for breast, cervical, and colorectal screening was low in both community samples relative to national averages, and for cervical cancer screening was significantly lower in Little Haiti than Hialeah (p<.01). In addition, knowledge of cervical cancer etiology was significantly greater in Hialeah than in Little Haiti (p<.01). Health insurance and having a usual source of health care were significant correlates of cancer screening. CONCLUSION: Given the disparities in cancer screening between our samples and the larger sociodemographic groups in which they are often included, targeted approaches that address structural barriers (lack of health insurance or usual source of care) may improve access to cancer screening among recent immigrants. Community partnerships may be essential in facilitating the interventions needed to overcome cancer-related disparities in these groups.

BACKGROUND: The relationship between type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and cancer incidence remains unclear. We sought to assess the all-cause and site-specific cancer incidence in patients with T1DM. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study design was employed, in which 14 619 patients with T1DM were retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance medical claims between 2000 and 2007. The study subjects were followed to the end of 2008, and cancer incidence was assessed. We calculated age-, sex-, and calendar year-standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of all-cause cancer incidence and site-specific neoplasm incidence, with reference to the general population. RESULTS: Seven hundred and sixty patients were identified for all-cause cancer over 86,610 person-years, representing an incidence rate of 87.75 cases per 10,000 person-years. The incidence rate was higher in males than in female patients (109.86 vs 69.75 cases per 10,000 person-years). T1DM was associated with a significantly increased SIR of all-cause cancer (1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.22). The sex-specific SIR was significantly elevated in female patients (1.19; 95% CI, 1.07-1.33), but the SIR for male patients was insignificantly elevated (1.09; 95% CI, 0.99-1.20). Pancreatic cancer showed the greatest increase in SIR among both male and female patients with T1DM. Male patients experienced significantly increased SIRs for kidney, rectum, liver, and colon neoplasm, and significantly increased SIRs were noted for ovarian, bladder, and colon cancer in female patients. CONCLUSIONS: T1DM was associated with a 13% increase in risk of all-cause cancer incidence. Patients with T1DM should be advised to undergo cancer screening for certain types of cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Whether a first-degree family history of others cancers (FHOC) than breast or ovarian cancer (BOC) is associated with breast cancer prognosis remains unknown. Thus, the aim of the present study was to clarify this issue. METHODS: Women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from 2010 to 2013 were included in the study. The demographic and clinicopathological characteristics of these patients were extracted. FHOC was considered positive for any patient who had a relative who had been diagnosed with cancer other than BOC. Disease-free survival (DFS) was calculated based on the date of diagnosis. DFS was analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS: A total of 434 breast cancer patients were included in this study. Among these patients, 61 (14.06%) had a positive FHOC in first-degree relatives. Patients with a positive FHOC tended to have HER2-positive breast cancer (p = 0.03). In the survival analysis, FHOC was associated with poor DFS in both univariate (HR = 2.21 (1.28-3.83), 95% CI: 1.28-3.83, p < 0.01) and multivariate (HR = 2.50, 95% CI: 1.24-5.04, p = 0.01) analyses, especially in patients with luminal A subtypes. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated an increased risk of recurrence in breast cancer patients with FHOC, especially in patients with luminal A subtype.

Cancer is a leading cause of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and vice versa. Pulmonary embolism is the second cause of death in cancer patients. Tumor progression is associated with coagulation activation. The pathogenesis of thrombosis during cancer is particularly complex stemming from multiple connections of this disease with both systems of inflammation and hemostasis. The risk of VTE depends on cancer type and the stage of the disease, the anticancer treatments and the time since cancer diagnosis as well as on the presence of patient-related risk factors (i.e. age, obesity, previous history of VTE, underlying diseases...). The presence of other precipitating factors and the duration of the exposure to them are also key elements in the assessment of such a thrombotic risk. It is therefore important to identify all the VTE risk factors to identify patients at high vascular risk and to determine the period during which this risk is significantly increased. The integration of biomarkers of hypercoagulability in proposed risk assessment models for VTE will improve their capacity to identify patients eligible for pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. In this review, we report the current status of knowledge on the connection between cancer and hypercoagulability, the numerous risk factors for VTE must be identified in cancer patients and the best methodology to build a more accurate assessment of this vascular risk in such a complex medical context.

Eastern European men have among the highest cancer mortality rates globally. Prevalence of smoking and alcohol intake in this region is also high. The aim of our study was to calculate population attributable risk fraction (PARF) of cancer deaths from smoking and alcohol in Russia, Belarus and Hungary, and to examine the contribution of these lifestyle factors to differences in male cancer mortality in the three countries. Data were collected as part of the PrivMort retrospective cohort study. Randomly selected participants living in mid-size towns in Russia, Belarus and Hungary provided information on smoking habits, alcohol consumption, vital status and cause of death (if applicable) of male relatives (fathers, siblings and partners). PARF of cancer deaths (age 35-79) due to smoking, alcohol consumption and both combined was estimated between 2001 and 2013. Among 72,190 men, 4,702 died of cancer. Age standardized cancer mortality rates were similar to official data in all three countries. The estimated PARF (95% CI) associated with measures of smoking, alcohol consumption, both combined, and overall smoking or drinking were 25% (19-30), 2% (0-4), 29% (19-39), 43% (32-53) in Russia, 18% (8-28), 2% (-1 to 6), 28% (20-35), 38% (25-50) in Belarus and 17% (13-20), 1% (0-3), 25% (20-30), 35% (28-42) in Hungary, respectively. These results suggest that in Eastern Europe, at least one third of cancer deaths in males may have been attributable to smoking and/or alcohol consumption in recent years. Health policies targeting these lifestyle factors can have a major impact on population health.

OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cancer incidence and mortality in Hebei cancer registry available areas in 2011. METHODS: Data were collected from 8 population-based cancer registries systems in Hebei province. Incidence and mortality rates stratified by areas (urban/rural), sex, age group and cancer site were analyzed. 10 common cancers in different groups, proportions and cumulative rates were calculated. The Chinese population census in the year 2000 and Segi's populations were used for age-standardized incidence/mortality rates. RESULTS: In all the 8 cancer registries that covering a total of 4 573 293 population (2 139 779 in urban and 2 433 514 in rural areas), data was used for the analysis. The total new cancer incidence cases and deaths were 11 269 and 7 477, respectively. All the morphologically verified cancer cases (MV%) accounted for 75.26% while 3.85% of the incident cases were identified only through death certification records (DCO%). The mortality to incidence ratio appeared as 0.66. The crude incidence appeared in the Hebei cancer registration areas was 246.41/10(5) (264.55/10(5) in males and 227.75/10(5) in females). The age-standardized incidence rates by Chinese standard population (ASIRC) and by world standard population (ASIRW) appeared as 207.13/10(5) and 206.61/10(5) respectively, with the cumulative incidence rates as (0-74 age years old) 23.57%. The cancer incidence and ASIRC were 242.64/10(5) and 200.19/10(5) in urban areas, whereas 249.72/10(5) and 214.11/10(5), respectively in rural areas. The crude mortality in Hebei cancer registration areas was 163.49/10(5) (196.54/10(5) in male, 129.51/10(5) in female), with age-standardized mortality rates by Chinese standard population (ASMRC) and by world standard population (ASMRW) as 144.48/10(5) and 147.69/10(5). The cumulative mortality rate (0-74 age years old) was 14.71%. The cancer mortality (167.91/10(5)) in rural areas seemed higher than the mortality (158.47/10(5)) in urban areas. The most common sites of cancers were: stomach, lung, esophagus, breast, liver and colorectal, which accounted for 71.66% of all the cancer cases. Lung cancer, stomach cancer, esophagus cancer, liver cancer and colorectal cancer were the major causes responsible for the cancer deaths in the areas with data of cancer registration, which accounted for 74.79% of all the cancer deaths. CONCLUSION: The coverage of Hebei cancer registration population could reflect the cancer burden in various areas and populations. The most commonly seen cancers were stomach, lung, esophagus, breast, liver, and colorectal, in Hebei province. In order to reduce the burden of cancers, prevention and control measures should be strengthened.

Patient-reported outcomes measures (proms) are an important component of the shift from disease-centred to person-centred care. In oncology, proms describe the effects of cancer and its treatment from the patient perspective and ideally enable patients to communicate to their providers the physical symptoms and psychosocial concerns that are most relevant to them. The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System-revised (esas-r) is a commonly used and validated tool in Canada to assess symptoms related to cancer. Here, we describe the extent to which patient-reported outcome programs have been implemented in Canada and the severity of symptoms causing distress for patients with cancer. As of April 2017, 8 of 10 provinces had implemented the esas-r to assess patient-reported outcomes. Data capture methods, the proportion of cancer treatment sites that have implemented the esas-r, and the time and frequency of screening vary from province to province. From October 2016 to March 2017 in the 8 reporting provinces, 88.0% of cancer patients were screened for symptoms. Of patients who reported having symptoms, 44.3% reported depression, with 15.5% reporting moderate-to-high levels; 50.0% reported pain, with 18.6% reporting moderate-to-high levels; 56.2% reported anxiety, with 20.4% reporting moderate-to-high levels; and 75.1% reported fatigue, with 34.4% reporting moderate-to-high levels. There are some notable areas in which the implementation of proms could be improved in Canada. Findings point to a need to increase the number of cancer treatment sites that screen all patients for symptoms; to standardize when and how frequently patients are screened across the country; to screen patients for symptoms during all phases of their cancer journey, not just during treatment; and to assess whether giving cancer care providers real-time patient-reported outcomes data has led to appropriate interventions that reduce the symptom burden and improve patient outcomes. Continued measurement and reporting at the system level will allow for a better understanding of progress in proms activity over time and of the areas in which targeted quality improvement efforts could ensure that patient symptoms and concerns are being addressed.

The tumor microenvironment (TME) contains stromal cells in a complex interaction with cancer cells. This relationship has become better understood with the use of fluorescent proteins for in vivo imaging, originally developed by our laboratories. Spectrally-distinct fluorescent proteins can used for color-coded imaging of the complex interaction of the tumor microenvironment in the living state using cancer cells expressing a fluorescent protein of one color and host mice expressing another-color fluorescent protein. Cancer cells engineered in vitro to express a fluorescent protein were orthotopically implanted into transgenic mice expressing a fluorescent protein of a different color. Confocal microscopy was then used for color-coded imaging of the TME. Color-coded imaging of the TME has enabled us to discover that stromal cells are necessary for metastasis. Patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) tumors were labeled by first passaging them orthotopically through transgenic nude mice expressing either green, red, or cyan fluorescent protein in order to label the stromal cells of the tumor. The colored stromal cells become stably associated with the PDOX tumors through multiple passages in transgenic colored mice or non-colored mice. The fluorescent protein-expressing stromal cells included cancer-associated fibroblasts and tumor-associated macrophages. The cancer cells in PDOX models can also be labeled with a telomerase-dependent adenovirus containing the gene for green fluorescent protein. Using this model, specific cancer-cell or stromal-cell targeting by potential therapeutics can be visualized. Color-coded imaging enabled the visualization of apparent fusion of cancer and stromal cells. Color-coded imaging is a powerful tool visualizing the interaction of cancer and stromal cells during cancer progression and treatment.

INTRODUCTION: Smoking has been causally linked to 12 tobacco-related cancers: oral cavity and pharynx, esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, liver, pancreas, larynx, lung, cervix, bladder, kidney, and acute myeloid leukemia. Tobacco-related cancers-related morbidity and mortality have been well described, but little is known about the prevalence of tobacco-related cancer hospitalizations and associated costs. This study estimates the annual number of tobacco-related cancer hospitalizations and their associated direct medical costs in the U.S. METHODS: This study examined data from the 2014 National Inpatient Sample, the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient care database in the U.S. The authors calculated number of hospitalizations, total costs, length of stay, and cost per stay for tobacco-related cancer hospitalizations and cancer hospitalizations not related to tobacco. RESULTS: In 2014, there were an estimated 461,295 annual tobacco-related cancer hospitalizations at a cost of $8.2 billion in the U.S. Tobacco-related cancers accounted for 45% of total cancer hospitalizations and cancer hospitalization costs. Compared with cancer hospitalizations not related to tobacco, tobacco-related cancer hospitalizations had a longer mean length of stay (6.8 vs 5.7 days). CONCLUSIONS: The burden of tobacco-related cancer hospitalizations is substantial in the U.S. These findings highlight the importance of tobacco prevention and cessation efforts to decrease the burden of tobacco-related cancers in the U.S.

AIM: This study aims to describe the current state of multiple primary malignant neoplasms (MPMNs) breast cancer patients management, evaluate the predictive impact of different factors, optimise approaches to diagnosis and treatment of these patients and improve their life quality. METHODS: The study included 2,032 patients who received special treatment at the Department of Breast Tumours and it Reconstructive Surgery of the National Cancer Institute from 2008 to 2015 within an open randomized controlled trial. The sample included 195 patients with synchronous cancer or metachronous breast cancer. RESULTS: A more aggressive course of breast cancer is observed in patients exposed to radiation from the Chornobyl accident. The clinical course of disease in patients with synchronous breast cancer is worse and prognostically unfavourable comparing to metachronous one. The influence on clinical course of disease of primary localization, type of settlement, blood group and Rh factor, type of special treatment, and age in patients with synchronous and metachronous cancer was not statistically proven. The impact of operative intervention scope in patients with synchronous and metachronous breast cancer was statistically proven, i.e. the course of the underlying disease in patients who underwent mastectomy is worse comparing to patients who underwent conservative surgery. Plastic and reconstructive surgery in patients with synchronous cancer was statistically proven in this study as reasonable. The influence of local recurrence rates on overall survival in patients with synchronous cancer was proven. However, the influence of local recurrence rates in patients with metachronous cancer was not statistically proven. CONCLUSIONS: There should be paid a great attention to synchronous and metachronous breast cancer patients in order to find and provide the best options of their management. This is crucial to continue researches in this field of oncology.

Reproductive health is a key component of cancer care and survivorship, encompassing gynecologic issues ranging from contraception and fertility to treatment of sexual dysfunction and menopause. Yet, oncology providers are often unfamiliar with the management of gynecologic issues. In order to address the unmet needs of female cancer patients, reproductive health should be addressed at the time of cancer diagnosis and continue through survivorship. Universal screening for pregnancy intention can guide counseling on contraception and fertility preservation. Safe and efficacious contraceptive options for both patients undergoing active treatment and cancer survivors are available and can often offer non-contraceptive benefits such as regulation of menses. Prompt referral to reproductive endocrinology specialists allows patients to explore options for fertility preservation prior to the receipt of cancer-directed therapies. Due to a rapid drop in hormone levels, treatment-induced menopause often results in severe symptoms. In patients with induced menopause, balancing the risks of hormone therapy compared to the decreased quality of life and health concerns associated with early menopause may help patients with difficult decisions regarding symptom control. Cancer treatment impacts sexual function with both physical changes to the vulvovaginal tissues and altered relationship dynamics. Open discussions on the impact to sexual health are paramount to quality of life after cancer. While more data is needed in many areas, proactive management of reproductive health issues is crucial to quality of life in cancer survivorship. In this article, we review contemporary management of the reproductive health of the female cancer patient.

Cancer development and metastasis are associated to perturbation in metabolic functions of tumor cells and surrounding inflammatory and stromal cell responses. Eicosanoids and lipid mediators, in this regard, attract potential attention during cancer development. Eicosanoids, which include prostaglandin, prostacyclin, thromboxane, and leukotriene, are synthesized from arachidonic acid when cells are stimulated by stress, cytokines, or other growth factors. However, the underlying mechanism of eicosanoids in cancer development, specially their interactions with proto-oncogene factors in tumor microenvironment, remain unexplored. On the other hand, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are a group of zinc-dependent endopeptidases which are involved in degradation of different extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. MMPs are associated with different physiological responses, including embryogenesis, vasculogenesis, and cellular remodeling, as well as different disease pathogenesis. Induced MMP responses are especially associated with cancer metastasis and secondary tumor development through proteolytic cleavage of several ECM and non-ECM proteins. Although both eicosanoids and MMPs are involved with cancer progression and metastasis, the interrelation between these two molecules are less explored. The present review discusses relevant studies that connect eicosanoids and MMPs and highlight the crosstalk between them offering novel therapeutic approach in cancer treatment.

BACKGROUND: Predicting early death after a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is very difficult in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop a scoring system to estimate risk of death at 100 days in elderly cancer patients to assist the therapeutic decision. METHODS: This was a multicentric, prospective cohort study approved by an ethics committee. Elderly cancer patients aged older than 70 years were enrolled before the final therapeutic decision. A standardised CGA was made before the treatment decision at baseline. Within 100 days, event (death), oncologic and geriatric data were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was used to select the risk factors for the overall population. Score points were assigned to each risk factor using the beta coefficient. Internal validation was performed by a bootstrap method. Calibration was assessed with the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test and accuracy with the mean c-statistic. FINDINGS: One thousand fifty patients (mean age: 82 years) joined the study from April 2012 to December 2014. The independent predictors were metastatic cancers (odds ratio [OR] 2.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], [1.7-3.5] p<0 .001); gait speed<0.8 m/s (OR 2.1; 95% CI [1.3-3.3] p=0.001); Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) < 17 (OR 8; 95% CI; [3.7-17.3] p<0.001), MNA </=23.5 and >/= 17 (OR 4.4; 95% CI, [2.1-9.1) p<0.001); performance status (PS) > 2 (OR 1.7; 95% CI, [1.1-2.6)] p=0.015) and cancers other than breast cancer (OR 4; 95% CI, [2.1-7.9] p<0.001). We attributed 4 points for MNA<17, 3 points for MNA between </=23.5 and >/= 17, 2 points for metastatic cancers, 1 point for gait speed <0.8 m/s, 1 point for PS > 2 and 3 points for cancers other than breast cancer. The risk of death at 100 days was 4% for 0 to 6 points, 24% for 7 to 8 points, 39% for 9 to 10 points and 67% for 11 points. INTERPRETATION: To our knowledge, this is the first score which estimates early death in elderly cancer patients. The system could assist in the treatment decision for elderly cancer patients.

PURPOSE: Genetic evaluation is increasingly becoming an integral part of the management of women with newly diagnosed breast and ovarian cancer (OC), and of individuals at high risk for these diseases. Genetic counseling and testing have been incorporated into oncological care to help and complete management and treatment strategies. Risk assessment and early detection strategies in individuals with BRCA1/2 mutations and with Lynch syndrome have been quite extensively studied, whereas much less is known about the management of mutation carriers with less common high-penetrance cancer susceptibility genes (PTEN, TP53, STK11, CDH1), and particularly those who carry mutations in moderate-penetrance genes (e.g., PALB2, CHEK2, ATM, NF1, RAD51C, RAD51D, BRIP1). METHODS: The latter patient groups represent important ongoing research opportunities to enable informed counseling about appropriate clinical management. CONCLUSION: We summarize the current guidelines for the management of high and moderate-penetrance mutations for breast and OC susceptibility. Continuous updating of guidelines for proper clinical management of these individuals is ongoing because of rapid advances in technology and knowledge in this field. Thus, we exhort the use of multigene panels for the assessment of cancer risk beyond the classic predisposition syndromes as a new standard of care in cancer genetics. We further support an increase of genetic counselors in Europe and use of their expertise to support genetic testing in specialist multidisciplinary teams.

The Cancer Registry of Puglia (RTP) was instituted in 2008 as a regional population-based cancer registry. It consists of six sections (Foggia, Barletta-Andria-Tran, Bari, Brindisi, Lecce, and Taranto) and covers more than 4 000 000 inhabitants. At present, four of six sections have received accreditation by AIRTUM (53% of regional population). To point out possible regional geographic variability in cancer incidence and also to support health services planning, we developed an original estimation method to ensure a complete territorial coverage. Incidence data of the four accredited RTP sections for the shared incidence period 2006-2008, the 2001-2009 hospitalization regional data, and 2006-2009 mortality data were considered. To take into account specific health features of different provinces, we performed an estimate of cancer incidence rates of nonaccredited sections using a combination of accredited sections rates and a factor that combines mortality and hospitalization ratios available for all the sections. Finally, we validated the method and we applied it to estimate regional cancer rates as the population-weighted average of accredited sections and nonaccredited sections adjusted rates. The validation process shows that estimated rates are close to real incidence data. The most frequent neoplasms in Apulia are breast (direct standardized rates 96.8 per 100 000 inhabitants), colon-rectum (36.6), and thyroid cancer (25.3) in women and prostate (70.2), lung (68.4), and colon-rectum cancer (52.2) in men. This method could be useful to assess the cancer incidence when complete cancer registration data are not available, but hospitalization, mortality, and neighbouring incidence data are available.

BACKGROUND: Most major cancer organizations seek to reduce sociodemographic disparities in high-risk cancers partly by increasing access to theoretically high-quality, academic-oriented cancer care. The objective of this study was to determine whether academic centers have less sociodemographic treatment disparities than community centers using high-risk prostate cancer as a test case. METHODS: The National Cancer Data Base was used to identify 138,019 patients who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic, high-risk prostate cancer from 2004 to 2012. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to identify independent determinants of definitive therapy. The Gray test and multivariable Cox regression were used to analyze the timing of therapy. All analyses were stratified by academic versus community cancer center. RESULTS: Compared with white or privately insured patients, black, Hispanic, and uninsured patients with prostate cancer were less likely to receive definitive therapy at both community centers (adjusted odds ratio: 0.60 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.56-0.64], 0.69 [95% CI, 0.61-0.78], and 0.25 [95% CI, 0.22-0.30], respectively) and academic cancer centers (adjusted odds ratio: 0.50 [95% CI, 0.46-0.54], 0.56 [95% CI, 0.50-0.64], and 0.31 [95% CI, 0.28-0.36], respectively). Among patients who received definitive therapy, black, Hispanic, and uninsured patients were more likely to experience treatment delays at both community centers (>/=15, >/= 10, and >/=19 days, respectively; all Gray P < .001) and academic centers (>/=19, >/= 11, and >/=18 days, respectively); treatment delays were observed among the aforementioned groups even after multivariable Cox regression analysis (P < .001 for all adjusted hazard ratios). CONCLUSIONS: Nationally, academic cancer centers demonstrate similarly high rates of sociodemographic disparities in cancer treatment patterns as community cancer centers. Making community centers conform to academic center standards may not necessarily reduce treatment disparities. Cancer 2016;122:3371-3377. (c) 2016 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: A decrease in cancer mortality has been reported in the United States, Europe, and other high-income regions during the last two decades. Whether similar trends apply to low-to-middle income countries-and globally-is unclear. DESIGN: The aim of this descriptive study is to compare cancer mortality in all countries with high- or intermediate-quality data on death certificates according to the World Health Organization (WHO) mortality database for the years 2000 through 2010. We included 60 countries in the analysis and calculated age-adjusted mortality rates for all cancer combined and for the commonest cancers worldwide: lung, stomach, breast, colorectal, uterine, and prostate. RESULTS: A decrease in overall cancer mortality rate of approximately 1% per year was observed in higher and lower income regions and in both sexes. In 2010, 696 000 cancer deaths were avoided on a global scale compared with 2000 rates (426 000 in men, 271 000 in women). However, the mortality of liver cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in females increased in many countries'. CONCLUSIONS: The individual risk of dying from cancer decreased in all countries with reliable data. This decrease was chiefly due to favorable trends in the commonest specific cancers. Liver cancer in both sexes and lung cancer in women, which show increasing mortality rates, constitute a priority for prevention and further research.

BACKGROUND: Nutrition labeling has been found to affect the amount and type of food intake, with certain groups in the population, such as cancer survivors, being more aware of this information. A higher awareness of nutrition labeling is inversely related to the risk of dyslipidemia. This study therefore assessed the association between awareness of nutrition labeling and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentration among cancer survivors in South Korea and in the general population of subjects without a history of cancer. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis evaluated 25,156 adults who participated in the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANES) from 2010 to 2016. Factors influencing the association between awareness of nutrition labeling and HDL-C concentration in cancer survivors and the general population were determined by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Of the 25,156 participants, 2.88% were cancer survivors and 97.12% had no history of cancer. HDL-C concentrations were higher in subjects who were aware of nutrition labeling than in subjects who were not. Checking or using nutrition labeling had a greater effect on the management of HDL-C concentration for cancer survivors than for the general population. CONCLUSION: Awareness of nutrition labeling was associated with better outcomes, including higher controlled HDL-C levels, and reductions in factors increasing the risk of coronary artery disease and cancer, especially in cancer survivors. Health policymakers or medical professionals should develop programs to promote the use of nutrition labeling among cancer survivors in South Korea.

BACKGROUND: Recent studies indicate that circular RNA (circRNA) plays a pivotal role in cancer progression. Here, we sought to investigate its role in breast cancer. METHODS: CircANKS1B (a circRNA originated from exons 5 to 8 of the ANKS1B gene, hsa_circ_0007294) was identified by RNA-sequencing and validated by qRT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. Clinical breast cancer samples were used to evaluate the expression of circANKS1B and its associations with clinicopathological features and prognosis. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments in cell lines and mouse xenograft models were performed to support clinical findings and elucidate the function and underlying mechanisms of circANKS1B in breast cancer. RESULTS: CircANKS1B was significantly up-regulated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) compared with non-TNBC tissues and cell lines. Increased circANKS1B expression was closely associated with lymph node metastasis and advanced clinical stage and served as an independent risk factor for overall survival of breast cancer patients. Functional studies revealed that circANKS1B promoted breast cancer invasion and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo by inducing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), while had no effect on breast cancer growth. Mechanistically, circANKS1B abundantly sponged miR-148a-3p and miR-152-3p to increase the expression of transcription factor USF1, which could transcriptionally up-regulate TGF-beta1 expression, resulting in activating TGF-beta1/Smad signaling to promote EMT. Moreover, we found that circANKS1B biogenesis in breast cancer was promoted by splicing factor ESRP1, whose expression was also regulated by USF1. CONCLUSIONS: Our data uncover an essential role of the novel circular RNA circANKS1B in the metastasis of breast cancer, which demonstrate that therapeutic targeting of circANKS1B may better prevent breast cancer metastasis.

BACKGROUND: Male breast cancer (MBC) as a second primary cancer (SPC) has a known association with prior MBC. However, its association with non-breast index malignancies, relative to population risk, has not been previously reported. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (9 catchment area) data, we identified MBCs diagnosed from 1973-2012 as their SPC. Information regarding the index malignancy was also obtained. Standardized incidence ratios (SIR) of MBC as SPC were estimated, along with incidence rates and trends. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to estimate survival. RESULTS: Over a 38-year period, 464 MBCs were identified as SPC. The most common index malignancies were breast (SIR 30.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 21.50-42.92, p < .001), lymphoma (SIR 1.58, 95% CI 1.08-2.22, p = .014), melanoma (SIR 1.26, 95% CI 0.80-1.89), urinary (SIR 1.05, 95% CI 0.74-1.43), colorectal (SIR 0.94, 95% CI 0.69-1.24), and prostate (SIR 0.93 95% CI 0.81-1.07). Apart from the known association with prior breast cancer, the only significant association was with lymphoma as an index cancer, although not significant with a Bonferroni correction. From 1975-2012, incidence of breast cancer as a first cancer increased at an annual percentage change of 1.3% while breast cancer as a SPC increased at 4.7% (both p values < .001). CONCLUSION: Male breast cancer as a SPC has increased markedly over 4 decades. Men with a history of lymphoma may experience higher-than-expected rates of breast SPC. These observations warrant further research, and suggest possible etiologic connections with disease biology, prior therapy, or genetics. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This study reports that men are presenting more frequently to the clinic with breast cancer, both as an initial cancer and as a second cancer following an earlier malignancy. We also report the novel observation that men who survive lymphoma are at increased risk of developing a subsequent breast cancer. Further work is needed to better understand possible treatment or biologic causes of this association. More immediately, these findings suggest the need for heightened vigilance for male breast cancer overall and, in particular, for male lymphoma survivors.

BACKGROUND: This cohort study examined the impact of the lengths of lookback and confirmation periods as well as the definition of confirmatory events on the number of incident cancer cases identified and age-standardized cumulative incidences (ACI) estimated in administrative data using German cancer registry data as a benchmark. METHODS: ACI per 100,000 insured persons for breast, prostate and colorectal cancer were estimated using BARMER Statutory Health Insurance claims data. Incident cancer cases were defined as having an in- or outpatient diagnosis in 2013, no diagnosis in a lookback period of 1 year and a second diagnosis (or death) in a confirmation period of 1 quarter. We varied lookback periods from 1 to 7 years, confirmation periods from 1 to 4 quarters as well as the definition of confirmatory events and compared ACI estimates to cancer registry data. RESULTS: ACI were higher for breast (138.7) and prostate (103.6) but lower for colorectal cancer (42.1) when compared to cancer registries (119.3, 98.0 and 45.5, respectively). Extending the lookback period to 7 years reduced ACI to 129.0, 95.1 and 38.3. An extended confirmation period of 4 quarters increased ACI to 151.3, 114.9 and 46.8. Including breast and colorectal surgeries as a confirmatory event reduced ACI to 114.9 and 37.1, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The choice of lookback and confirmation periods and the definition of confirmatory events have considerable impact on the number of incident cancer cases identified and ACI estimated. Researchers need to be aware of potential misclassification when identifying incident cancer cases in administrative data. Further validation studies as well as studies using administrative data to estimate cancer incidences should consider several choices of the lookback and confirmation periods and the definition of confirmatory events to show how these parameters impact the validity and robustness of their results.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the incidence of ovarian malignant involvement in young and premenopausal endometrioid endometrial cancer and study the possible risk factors. METHODS: Premenopausal patients 45 years of age or younger with endometrioid endometrial cancer treated at the OB/GYN Hospital of Fudan University between 2009 and 2013 were identified. The incidence of ovarian malignant involvement in young and premenopausal endometrioid endometrial cancer patients were calculated and the possible risk factors were investigated. RESULTS: A total of 144 younger (age</=45, premenopausal) patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer were identified and coexisting malignant ovarian neoplasms were detected in 6 patients. Univariate analysis revealed that deeper myometrial invasion, positive lymphonode metastasis, positive LVSI, and high histologic grade (G2-G3) were associated with ovarian involvement in younger endometrial cancer patients. However, multivariate analysis revealed that only deep myometrial invasion was an independent risk factors for ovarian involvement (OR=12.81, P=0.046). CONCLUSION: In conclusions, the incidence of coexisting ovarian malignant neoplasms in young and premenopausal patients with endometrioid endometrial cancer is low, and these findings may facilitate preoperative counseling of patients and decision making at the time of surgery.

BACKGROUND: Low socioeconomic status and poor education elevate the risk of developing esophageal- and junctional cancer. High education level also increases survival after curative surgery. The present study aimed to investigate associations, if any, between patient education-level and treatment allocation after diagnosis of esophageal- and junctional cancer and its subsequent impact on survival. METHODS: A nation-wide cohort study was undertaken. Data from a Swedish national quality register for esophageal cancer (NREV) was linked to the National Cancer Register, National Patient Register, Prescribed Drug Register, Cause of Death Register and educational data from Statistics Sweden. The effect of education level (low; </=9 years, intermediate; 10-12 years and high >12years) on the probability of allocation to curative treatment was analyzed with logistic regression. The Kaplan-Meier-method and Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the effect of education on survival. RESULTS: A total of 4112 patients were included. In a multivariate logistic regression model, high education level was associated with greater probability of allocation to curative treatment (adjusted OR: 1.48, 95% CI: 1.08-2.03, p=0,014) as was adherence to a multidisciplinary treatment-conference (adjusted OR: 3.13, 95% CI: 2.40-4.08, p<0,001). High education level was associated with improved survival in the patients allocated to curative treatment (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.69-0.99, p=0,036). DISCUSSION: In this nation-wide cohort of esophageal- and junctional cancer patients, including data regarding many confounders, high education level was associated with greater probability of being offered curative treatment and improved survival.

The number of people living with and beyond cancer is at an all time high. These survivors are not necessarily living well, as adverse side effects from cancer and its treatment can last up to 5 years and leave patients at a higher risk of developing secondary cancers and other chronic illnesses. Exercise has been proven to be a safe and effective method of intervention to decrease mortality and overall improve health outcomes. The biological mechanism through which this occurs is an area of research that is in its infancy and not well defined. A systematic search was conducted of four databases for relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2004 and December 2014. Studies had to include any blood/urine biological markers as an outcome measure to a physical activity intervention for cancer survivors posttreatment. Fifteen relevant articles were identified (12 RCTs). It was shown that randomized controlled trials of exercise for cancer survivors posttreatment may results in changes to circulating levels of insulin, insulin related pathways (insulin like growth factor II [IGF II], IGF binding protein 3), high density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, leptin, and osteocalcin. Due to small sample sizes, the evidence is still preliminary and therefore more research is warranted in this area in the form of larger, statistically powered RCTs for cancer survivors.

Purpose Survivors of childhood cancer treated with cranial radiation therapy are at risk for subsequent CNS tumors. However, significant interindividual variability in risk suggests a role for genetic susceptibility and provides an opportunity to identify survivors of childhood cancer at increased risk for these tumors. Methods We curated candidate genetic variants from previously published studies in adult-onset primary CNS tumors and replicated these in survivors of childhood cancer with and without subsequent CNS tumors (82 participants and 228 matched controls). We developed prediction models to identify survivors at high or low risk for subsequent CNS tumors and validated these models in an independent matched case-control sample (25 participants and 54 controls). Results We demonstrated an association between six previously published single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs15869 [ BRCA2], rs1805389 [ LIG4], rs8079544 [ TP53], rs25489 [ XRCC1], rs1673041 [ POLD1], and rs11615 [ ERCC1]) and subsequent CNS tumors in survivors of childhood cancer. Including genetic variants in a Final Model containing age at primary cancer, sex, and cranial radiation therapy dose yielded an area under the curve of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.86), which was superior ( P = .002) to the Clinical Model (area under the curve, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.66 to 0.80). The prediction model was successfully validated. The sensitivity and specificity of predicting survivors of childhood cancer at highest or lowest risk of subsequent CNS tumors was 87.5% and 83.5%, respectively. Conclusion It is possible to identify survivors of childhood cancer at high or low risk for subsequent CNS tumors on the basis of genetic and clinical information. This information can be used to inform surveillance for early detection of subsequent CNS tumors.

CONTEXT: Patients diagnosed with a cancer have a life time risk of developing another de novo malignancy depending on various inherited, environmental and iatrogenic risk factors. Of late the detection of new primary has increased mainly due to refinement in both diagnostic and treatment modalities. Cancer victims are surviving longer and thus are more likely to develop a new metachronous malignancy. AIMS: To report our observed trend of increase in prevalence of both synchronous and metachronous second malignant neoplasms among cancer victims and to review the relevant literature. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A hospital based retrospective collection of prospective data of patients diagnosed with second denovo malignancy. MATERIALS AND METHOD: The study was conducted over a 5 year period from July 2008 to June 2012. All patients diagnosed with a histologically proven second malignancy as per Warren Gate's criteria were included. Various details regarding sex, age at presentation, synchronous or metachronous, treatment and outcome were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of multiple primary malignancies is not rare. Awareness of the possibility alerts the clinician in evaluation of patients with a known malignancy presenting with unusual sites of metastasis. Individualizing the treatment according to the stages of the primaries will result in durable cancer control particularly in synchronous double malignancy.

BACKGROUND: Stage II and III rectal cancers have been effectively treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) followed by definitive resection. Advancements in surgical technique and systemic therapy have prompted investigation of neoadjuvant multiagent chemotherapy (NMAC) regimens with the elimination of radiation (RT). The objective of the current study was to investigate factors that predict for the use of NCRT versus NMAC and compare outcomes using the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) for select stage II and III rectal cancers. METHODS: In the NCDB, 21,707 patients from 2004 through 2012 with clinical T2N1 (cT2N1), cT3N0, or cT3N1 rectal cancers were identified who had received NCRT or NMAC followed by low anterior resection. Kaplan-Meier analyses, log-rank tests, and Cox-proportional hazards regression analyses were conducted along with propensity score matching analysis to reduce treatment selection bias. RESULTS: The 5-year actuarial overall survival (OS) rate was 75% for patients who received NCRT versus 67.2% for those who received NMAC (P < .01). On MVA, those who received NCRT had improved OS (hazard ratio, 0.77. P < .01), and this effect was confirmed on propensity score matching analysis (hazard ratio, 0.72; P = .01). In the same model, the following variables improved OS: age < 65 years, having private insurance, treatment at an academic center, living in an affluent zip code, a low comorbidity score, receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy, and a shorter interval before surgery (all P < .05). African Americans, men, patients with high-grade tumors, those with cT3N1 tumors, and those who underwent incomplete (R1) resection had worse OS (all P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: In this series, the elimination of neoadjuvant RT for select patients with stage II and III rectal adenocarcinoma was associated with worse OS and should not be recommended outside of a clinical trial.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to estimate the proportion and number of cancer cases diagnosed in Ontario in 2012 that are attributable to alcohol consumption and to compare the impact of drinking within two sets of guidelines on alcohol-attributable cancer incidence. METHODS: We estimated the proportion of cancers in Ontario attributable to alcohol consumption by calculating population-attributable fractions (PAFs) for six cancer types using drinking prevalence from the 2000/2001 Canadian Community Health Survey and relative risks from a meta-analysis. Each PAF was multiplied by the number of incident cancers in 2012, allowing for a 12-year latency period, to calculate the number of alcohol-attributable cases. We also estimated the number of alcohol-attributable cases under two scenarios: (1) assuming consumption had not exceeded the levels recommended by the Low-Risk Alcohol Drinking Guidelines (LRADG) and (2) assuming consumption had not exceeded the recommended levels by the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) guidelines. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred ninety-five (95% confidence interval 1093-1499) new cases of cancer diagnosed in Ontario during 2012 are estimated to be attributed to alcohol consumption, representing approximately 1.7% (1.4-1.9%) of all new cancer cases. If no Ontario adults had exceeded the LRADG, an estimated 321 fewer cancer cases could have been diagnosed in 2012, whereas an estimated 482 fewer cancer cases could have been diagnosed if no Ontario adults had exceeded the stricter WCRF/AICR guidelines. CONCLUSION: Strategies to limit alcohol consumption to the levels recommended by drinking guidelines could potentially reduce the cancer burden in Ontario.

PURPOSE: There is a paucity of information regarding health related quality of life (HRQoL) of young adults (YAs) with cancer and caregivers. Therefore, we characterize YA and caregiver perspectives on the impact of cancer and its treatment on HRQoL. METHODS: We conducted descriptive qualitative in-depth, semi-structured interviews with YAs receiving cancer care at an academic health center in Albuquerque, New Mexico (USA) and primary informal caregivers. The interviews, conducted from September through December 2015, focused on perspectives on the impact of the disease and its treatment in terms of physical and emotional effects, coping, and strategies to enhance HRQoL. We used an iterative thematic analysis approach to identify emergent themes and create a coding structure. RESULTS: We reached thematic saturation after interviewing 8 YAs and 8 caregivers. YAs and caregivers discussed cancer triggered challenges such as anxiety, depression, isolation, fear, and financial hardships. YAs and caregivers coped by maintaining positive perspectives, relying on friends and family, and prayer. Caregivers discussed how expectations for and experiences of a "good day" changed depending on their loved ones' stage of cancer treatment. YAs navigated challenges by focusing on activities and thoughts that provided meaning to their lives. YAs and caregivers suggested strategies to enhance HRQoL through patient/provider communication, support services, and decision making tools as potential mechanisms for grounding patient-centered interventions to improve cancer care. CONCLUSIONS: Implications include the development and evaluation of informational and behavioral interventions tailored and targeted to address the pragmatic needs of YAs undergoing cancer treatment and informal caregivers.

BACKGROUND: Patient-reported toxicities help to appraise the breast cancer treatment experience. Yet extant data come from clinical trials and health care claims, which may be biased. Using patient surveys, the authors sought to quantify the frequency, severity, and burden of treatment-associated toxicities. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2014, the iCanCare study surveyed a population-based sample of women residing in Los Angeles County and Georgia with early-stage, invasive breast cancer. The authors assessed the frequency and severity of toxicities; correlated toxicity severity with unscheduled health care use (clinic visits, emergency department visits/hospitalizations) and physical health; and examined patient, tumor, and treatment factors associated with reporting increased toxicity severity. RESULTS: The overall survey response rate was 71%. From the analyzed cohort of 1945 women, 866 (45%) reported at least 1 toxicity that was severe/very severe, 9% reported unscheduled clinic visits for toxicity management, and 5% visited an emergency department or hospital. Factors associated with reporting higher toxicity severity included receipt of chemotherapy (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 2.0-2.5), receipt of both chemotherapy and radiotherapy (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.0-1.7), and Latina ethnicity (OR vs whites: 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5). A nonsignificant increase in at least 1 severe/very severe toxicity report was observed for bilateral mastectomy recipients (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4). CONCLUSIONS: Women with early-stage invasive breast cancer report substantial treatment-associated toxicities and related burden. Clinicians should collect toxicity data routinely and offer early intervention. Toxicity differences observed by treatment modality may inform decision making. Cancer 2017;123:1925-1934.

BACKGROUND: The use of chemotherapeutics during pregnancy is a dilemma for both the patient and the clinician. We report here our 11 years' experience with the use of chemotherapy during pregnancy. PATIENTS: 13 patients undergoing chemotherapy during their current pregnancy were evaluated. The medical data of 5 patients with hematologic malignancies (2 Hodgkin's, 2 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 1 chronic myeloid leukemia), 6 patients with breast cancer, 1 patients with nasopharyngeal cancer, and 1 patient with choriocarcinoma were retrospectively obtained from the 'perinatal database' of Hacettepe University for the period of January 2002 through March 2016. RESULTS: 4 patients had a medical termination due to teratologic effects. 4 patients had a vaginal delivery, and 5 patients delivered by caesarean section. The 9 newborns who had been exposed to chemotherapeutics were free of congenital anomalies. However, 1 of them died in the early neonatal period due to multi-organ failure (nasopharyngeal cancer). During the 2-year follow-up, we encountered 1 maternal mortality, which was due to multi-organ failure in a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma patient. CONCLUSION: Physicians must pay attention to potential teratologic problems, and should carefully balance maternal and fetal risks. Selected chemotherapeutic agents can be given in the 2nd and 3rd trimester without any major teratogenic risk. All 9 newborns in our study were free of anomalies, although 1 of them died in the neonatal period.

Cell therapy is an advanced form of cancer immunotherapy that has had remarkable clinical progress in the past decade in the search for cure of cancer. Most success has been achieved for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cells where CAR T-cells targeting CD19 show very high complete response rates for patients with refractory acute B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are close to approval for this indication. CD19 CAR T-cells are also effective against B-cell chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell lymphomas. Although encouraging, CAR T-cells have not yet proven clinically effective for solid tumors. This is mainly due to the lack of specific and homogenously expressed targets to direct the T-cells against and a hostile immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment in solid tumors. Cancer vaccines based on dendritic cells (DC) are also making progress although clinical efficacy is still lacking. The likelihood of success is however increasing now when individual tumors can be sequences and patient-specific neoepitopes identified. Neoepitopes and/or neoantigens can then be included in patient-based DC vaccines. This review discusses recent advancements of DC vaccines and CAR T-cells with emphasis on the cancer-immunity cycle, and current efforts to design novel cell therapies.

BACKGROUND: Cancer has long inspired fear, but the effect of fear is not well understood; it seems both to facilitate and to deter early diagnosis behaviours. To elucidate fear's behavioural effects, we systematically reviewed and synthesised qualitative literature to explore what people fear about cancer. METHODS: We searched Medline, Embase, PsycInfo, Web of Science, AnthroSource, and Anthrobase for studies on cancer fear in breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer screening and analysed 102 studies from 26 countries using thematic synthesis. RESULTS: Fears of cancer emanated from a core view of cancer as a vicious, unpredictable, and indestructible enemy, evoking fears about its proximity, the (lack of) strategies to keep it at bay, the personal and social implications of succumbing, and fear of dying from cancer. CONCLUSIONS: This view of cancer as 'an enemy' reprises the media's 'war on cancer' theme and may affect the acceptance of cancer early detection and prevention messages, since cancer's characteristics influenced whether 'fight' or 'flight' was considered appropriate.

Markedly increased red meat consumption is a cancer risk factor, while dietary flavonoids may help prevent the disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate the associations of red meat and flavonoid consumption with cancer risk, based on data from 8024 subjects, drawn from the 2004-2008 Cancer Screening Examination Cohort of the Korean National Cancer Center. Hazard ratios (HRs) were obtained by using a Cox proportional hazard model. During the mean follow-up period of 10.1 years, 443 cases were newly diagnosed with cancer. After adjusting for age, there was a significant correlation between cancer risk and the daily intake of >/=43 g of red meat per day (HR 1.31; 95% CI 1.01, 1.71; p = 0.045), and total flavonoid intake tended to decrease cancer risk (HR 0.70; 95% CI 0.49, 0.99; highest vs. lowest quartile; p-trend = 0.073) in men. Following multivariable adjustment, there were no statistically significant associations between flavonoid intake and overall cancer risk in individuals with high levels of red meat intake. Men with low daily red meat intake exhibited an inverse association between flavonoid consumption and cancer incidence (HR 0.41; 95% CI 0.21, 0.80; highest vs. lowest; p-trend = 0.017). Additional research is necessary to clarify the effects of flavonoid consumption on specific cancer incidence, relative to daily red meat intake.

INTRODUCTION: Liquid biopsies (LBs) are referred to as the sampling and analysis of non-solid tissue, primarily blood, as a diagnostic and monitoring tool for cancer. Because LBs are largely non-invasive, they are a less-costly alternative for serial analysis of tumor progression and heterogeneity to facilitate clinical management. Although a variety of tumor markers are proposed (e.g., free-circulating DNA), the clinical evidence for Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) is currently the most developed. Areas covered: This paper presents a health economic perspective of LBs in cancer management. We first briefly introduce the requirements in biomarker development and validation, illustrated for CTCs. Second, we discuss the state-of-art on the clinical utility of LBs in breast cancer in more detail. We conclude with a future perspective on the clinical use and reimbursement of LBs Expert commentary: A significant increase in clinical research on LBs can be observed and the results suggest a rapid change of cancer management. In addition to studies evaluating clinical utility of LBs, a smooth translation into clinical practice requires systematic assessment of the health economic benefits. This paper argues that (early stage) health economic research is required to facilitate its clinical use and to prioritize further evidence development.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is increasing use of fertility medications for ovulation induction and ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization in the treatment of female infertility. In this review, recent literature regarding the association between fertility medication and cancer risk is reviewed. RECENT FINDINGS: Several important publications have recently addressed the relationship between use of fertility medications and cancer risk. There are methodological limitations to many of these studies, including unique challenges in studying rare cancers that often develop several years after the time of fertility medication exposure. Although infertility per se is a risk factor for some female cancers, including breast, endometrial and ovarian cancer, most studies do not show a significant risk of these cancers with the use of fertility medications. Some studies, however, have shown a possible increased relative risk of borderline ovarian cancer, although the increased absolute risk is small without a clear causal relationship. SUMMARY: The collective data regarding the risk of developing cancer from use of fertility medications are reassuring, although several methodological issues in these studies limit definitive conclusions.

BACKGROUND: Several highly specific bedside physical signs associated with impending death within 3 days for patients with advanced cancer were recently identified. A diagnostic model for impending death based on these physical signs was developed and assessed. METHODS: Sixty-two physical signs were systematically documented every 12 hours from admission to death or discharge for 357 patients with advanced cancer who were admitted to acute palliative care units (APCUs) at 2 tertiary care cancer centers. Recursive partitioning analysis was used to develop a prediction model for impending death within 3 days with admission data. The model was validated with 5 iterations of 10-fold cross-validation, and the model was also applied to APCU days 2 to 6. RESULTS: For the 322 of 357 patients (90%) with complete data for all signs, the 3-day mortality rate was 24% on admission. The final model was based on 2 variables (Palliative Performance Scale [PPS] and drooping of nasolabial folds) and had 4 terminal leaves: PPS score </= 20% and drooping of nasolabial folds present, PPS score </= 20% and drooping of nasolabial folds absent, PPS score of 30% to 60%, and PPS score >/= 70%. The 3-day mortality rates were 94%, 42%, 16%, and 3%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy was 81% for the original tree, 80% for cross-validation, and 79% to 84% for subsequent APCU days. CONCLUSIONS: Based on 2 objective bedside physical signs, a diagnostic model was developed for impending death within 3 days. This model was applicable to both APCU admission and subsequent days. Upon further external validation, this model may help clinicians to formulate the diagnosis of impending death.

As many as 48% of cancer patients pursue popular diets, including the alkaline, Paleolithic, ketogenic, vegan, and macrobiotic diets, with the hope that they will improve survival and prevent recurrence. These diets have positive aspects consistent with the dietary guidelines proposed by the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the American Institute for Cancer Research (AICR). All of the diets emphasize eating vegetables, all but the ketogenic diet encourage eating fruit, and all but the vegan diet limit refined grains and alcohol. Both the macrobiotic and the alkaline diets meet the majority of the ACS and AICR guidelines. Negative aspects of these diets include pseudo-scientific rationales for their anti-cancer properties, limited evidence that they improve cancer outcomes, the possibility for nutrient insufficiencies, and elimination of food groups proven beneficial for cancer prevention and general health. Moreover, with nutritional counseling, nutrient insufficiencies and misalignment with cancer clinical guidelines can often be addressed. Clinicians should consider strategies to encourage evidence-based dietary changes that encourage positive features of popular cancer diets, while minimizing negative aspects.

BACKGROUND: Our recent study showed that a low lipoproteinemia(a) [Lp(a)] level was a risk factor for cancer and all-cause deaths. The purpose of this study was to verify the role of the Lp(a) level on cancer among consecutive autopsy cases. METHODS: The subjects consisted of 1354 cases (775 men and 579 women). The average age at death was 79.9 years. Hypolipoproteinemia(a) was defined as an Lp(a) level of below 80 mg/L. Overall, 62.3% of the subjects had suffered from at least one to a maximum of five malignancies throughout their lives. The most frequent type of malignancy was gastric cancer, followed by leukemia, lung cancer, and colon cancer. RESULTS: The cancer-bearing status decreased linearly according to the Lp(a) level in both men and women (P=0.01 and P<0.001, respectively). The median Lp(a) level was significantly lower among the cases with hepato-biliary-pancreatic cancers or hematopoietic malignancy, but was higher among cases with lung cancer, especially lung adenocarcinoma. Hypolipoproteinemia(a) was a significant risk factor for any origins of cancer, with an odds ratio of 1.94 (95% CI, 1.45-2.60; P<0.001). It was also a risk factor for hepato-biliary cancers and leukemia, but it was a protective factor for lung cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested hypolipoproteinemia(a) would be a significant risk factor for cancer except lung cancer. This study complements our previous study showing that hypolipoproteinemia(a) would increase the lifetime risk of cancer other than lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Black women are disproportionately affected with triple-negative breast cancer and have relatively poor survival. To the authors' knowledge, it is not known to what extent differences in the clinical presentation of breast cancer between non-Hispanic white women and black women can be accounted for by the presence of mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. The authors sought to evaluate the frequency of BRCA pathogenic variants in a population-based sample of young black women with breast cancer. METHODS: Black women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer at age </=50 years from 2009 to 2012 were recruited to the study through the Florida Cancer Registry. Participants underwent genetic counseling, completed a study questionnaire, and consented to release of their medical records. Saliva specimens were collected for BRCA sequencing and large rearrangement testing through multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. RESULTS: A DNA sample was evaluated for 396 women, 49 of whom (12.4%) had a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Eight recurrent mutations accounted for 49% of all pathogenic variants. CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, the prevalence of BRCA mutations among the Florida-based sample of young black women with breast cancer in the current study exceeds that previously reported for non-Hispanic white women. It is appropriate to recommend BRCA testing in all young black women with invasive breast cancer.

BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a collective term for two conditions: deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE). A proportion of people with VTE have no underlying or immediately predisposing risk factors and the VTE is referred to as unprovoked. Unprovoked VTE can often be the first clinical manifestation of an underlying malignancy. This has raised the question of whether people with an unprovoked VTE should be investigated for an underlying cancer. Treatment for VTE is different in cancer and non-cancer patients and a correct diagnosis would ensure that people received the optimal treatment for VTE to prevent recurrence and further morbidity. Furthermore, an appropriate cancer diagnosis at an earlier stage could avoid the risk of cancer progression and lead to improvements in cancer-related mortality and morbidity. This is an update of a review first published in 2015. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT of the lower limb or PE) is effective in reducing cancer or VTE-related mortality and morbidity and to determine which tests for cancer are best at identifying treatable cancers early. SEARCH METHODS: The Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist searched the Cochrane Vascular Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and CINAHL databases and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov trials registers to 11 July 2018. We also undertook reference checking to identify additional studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised and quasi-randomised trials in which people with an unprovoked VTE were allocated to receive specific tests for identifying cancer or clinically indicated tests only were eligible for inclusion. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cancer-related mortality and VTE-related mortality. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We resolved any disagreements by discussion. MAIN RESULTS: No new studies were identified for this 2018 update. In total, four studies with 1644 participants are included. Two studies assessed the effect of extensive tests including computed tomography (CT) scanning versus tests at the physician's discretion, while the other two studies assessed the effect of standard testing plus positron emission tomography (PET)/CT scanning versus standard testing alone. For extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, the quality of the evidence, as assessed according to GRADE, was low due to risk of bias (early termination of the studies). When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT scanning versus standard testing alone, the quality of evidence was moderate due to a risk of detection bias. The quality of the evidence was downgraded further as detection bias was present in one study with a low number of events.When comparing extensive tests including CT versus tests at the physician's discretion, pooled analysis on two studies showed that testing for cancer was consistent with either benefit or no benefit on cancer-related mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 1.67; 396 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.26; low-quality evidence). One study (201 participants) showed that, overall, malignancies were less advanced at diagnosis in extensively tested participants than in participants in the control group. In total, 9/13 participants diagnosed with cancer in the extensively tested group had a T1 or T2 stage malignancy compared to 2/10 participants diagnosed with cancer in the control group (OR 5.00, 95% CI 1.05 to 23.76; P = 0.04; low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference in detection of advanced stages between extensive tests versus tests at the physician's discretion: one participant in the extensively tested group had stage T3 compared with four participants in the control group (OR 0.25, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.28; P = 0.22; low-quality evidence). In addition, extensively tested participants were diagnosed earlier than control group (mean: 1 month with extensive tests versus 11.6 months with tests at physician's discretion to cancer diagnosis from the time of diagnosis of VTE). Extensive testing did not increase the frequency of an underlying cancer diagnosis (OR 1.32, 95% CI 0.59 to 2.93; 396 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.50; low-quality evidence). Neither study measured all-cause mortality, VTE-related morbidity and mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life.When comparing standard testing plus PET/CT screening versus standard testing alone, standard testing plus PET/CT screening was consistent with either benefit or no benefit on all-cause mortality (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.49 to 3.04; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.66; moderate-quality evidence), cancer-related mortality (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.20 to 1.52; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.25; moderate-quality evidence) or VTE-related morbidity (OR 1.02, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.17; 854 participants; 1 study; P = 0.96; moderate-quality evidence). Regarding stage of cancer, there was no clear difference for detection of early (OR 1.78, 95% 0.51 to 6.17; 394 participants; 1 study; P = 0.37; low-quality evidence) or advanced (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.14 to 7.17; 394 participants; 1 study; P = 1.00; low-quality evidence) stages of cancer. There was also no clear difference in the frequency of an underlying cancer diagnosis (OR 1.71, 95% CI 0.91 to 3.20; 1248 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.09; moderate-quality evidence). Time to cancer diagnosis was 4.2 months in the standard testing group and 4.0 months in the standard testing plus PET/CT group (P = 0.88). Neither study measured VTE-related mortality, complications of anticoagulation, adverse effects of cancer tests, participant satisfaction or quality of life. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Specific testing for cancer in people with unprovoked VTE may lead to earlier diagnosis of cancer at an earlier stage of the disease. However, there is currently insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions concerning the effectiveness of testing for undiagnosed cancer in people with a first episode of unprovoked VTE (DVT or PE) in reducing cancer- or VTE-related morbidity and mortality. The results could be consistent with either benefit or no benefit. Further good-quality large-scale randomised controlled trials are required before firm conclusions can be made.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of SERPINA3 on the migration, invasion, and liver metastasis of colon cancer cells. METHODS: Immunohistochemical staining was conducted to determine SERPINA3 expression in the cancer and adjacent normal tissues of 131 patients suffering from colon cancer. In vitro experiment, colon cancer cells with low (HT-29P), intermediate (KM-12C), and high (HT-29LMM, KM-12L4) metastatic potential were obtained to examine SERPINA3 expression levels. Besides, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and Western Blot were performed to detect SERPINA3 expression in HT-29LMM and KM-12L4 cells transfected with SERPINA3 siRNA; Wound-healing and Transwell assays to measure cell migration and invasion, respectively; and ELISA to detect MMP-2 and MMP-9 levels. In vivo experiment, mice with liver metastasis of colon cancer were established to observe the effect of SERPINA3 silencing on liver metastasis. Immunohistochemical assay was applied to evaluate the expressions of Serpina3, Mmp-2, Mmp-9, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (Pcna) in liver metastasis tissues. RESULTS: SERPINA3 in colon cancer tissues was higher than in adjacent normal tissues, which was associated with patients' clinicopathological features. Besides, SERPINA3 expression showed a rising trend in low, intermediate, and high metastatic potential colon cancer cells. After KM-12L4 and HT-29LMM cells transfected with SERPINA3 siRNA, the migration and invasive ability of cells, as well as the expression levels of MMP-2 and MMP-9 were all decreased. Moreover, SERPINA3 siRNA could not only reduce live metastasis of mice, but also down-regulate the expression of Mmp-2 and Mmp-9 in liver metastasis tissues. CONCLUSION: SERPINA3 silencing could inhibit the migration, invasion, and liver metastasis of colon cancer cells.

Cancer microenvironment is the critical battle ground between the cancer cells and host response. Thus, more emphasis is directed to study the relationship between cancer cells and the stromal cells. Multiplex microscopy is an emerging technique in which multiple cell populations within the cancer microenvironment may be stained so that spatial relationship between cancer cells and, in particular, the immune cells may be studied during different stages of cancer development. Recent discovery of mutational burden and neoantigens in cancer has opened new landscapes in the interaction of host immune cells and cancer neoantigens. The emerging role of miRNAs may become an added dimension to study cancer beyond traditional pathway of DNA directed RNA being associated with the malignant behavior of cancer. Circulating tumor cells, cancer markers and ctDNA can be used as markers for circulating cancer cells in the blood. Further studies are needed to validate if liquid biopsy of cancer may become a routine clinical tool to screen cancer or follow patients for recurrence or responses to treatment.

BACKGROUND: Higher levels of physical activity (PA) after treatment are associated with beneficial effects on physical and psychosocial functioning of cancer survivors. However, survivors often do not meet the recommended levels of PA. In order to promote PA, we developed a closed internet-based program. The aim of the study is to evaluate the (cost-)effectiveness of an internet-based PA-promotion program, alone or combined with physiotherapy counselling, compared to usual care, on PA-levels of breast or prostate cancer survivors. In this multicenter randomised controlled trial (RCT), breast or prostate cancer survivors who completed their primary treatment 3-12 months earlier, will be randomised to either 6-months access to a fully-automated internet-based intervention alone, an internet-based intervention plus remote support by a physiotherapist, or a control group. The intervention is based on the Transtheoretical Model and includes personalized feedback, information, video's and assignments. Additionally, in a second arm, physiotherapy counselling is provided through monthly scheduled and on-demand telephone calls. The control group will receive usual care and a leaflet with PA guidelines. METHODS: At baseline, 6 and 12 months, the primary outcome (PA) will be measured during 7 consecutive days by accelerometers. Secondary outcomes are self-reported PA, fatigue, mood, health-related quality of life, and costs. The group differences for primary and secondary outcomes will be analyzed using linear mixed models. DISCUSSION: If proven to be (cost)effective, this internet-based intervention, either alone or in combination with telephone support, will be a welcome addition to previous RCT's. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Netherlands trial register (NTR6911), Date of trial registration: December 21, 2017.

OBJECTIVE: European cancer survival rates vary widely. System factors, including whether or not primary care physicians (PCPs) are gatekeepers, may account for some of these differences. This study explores where patients who may have cancer are likely to present for medical care in different European countries, and how probability of presentation to a primary care clinician correlates with cancer survival rates. DESIGN: Seventy-eight PCPs in a range of European countries assessed four vignettes representing patients who might have cancer, and consensus groups agreed how likely those patients were to present to different clinicians in their own countries. These data were compared with national cancer survival rates. SETTING: A total of 14 countries. SUBJECTS: Consensus groups of PCPs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Probability of initial presentation to a PCP for four clinical vignettes. RESULTS: There was no significant correlation between overall national 1-year relative cancer survival rates and the probability of initial presentation to a PCP (r = -0.16, 95% CI -0.39 to 0.08). Within that there was large variation depending on the type of cancer, with a significantly poorer lung cancer survival in countries where patients were more likely to initially consult a PCP (lung r = -0.57, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.12; ovary: r = -0.13, 95% CI -0.57 to 0.38; breast r = 0.14, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.58; bowel: r = 0.20, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.62). CONCLUSIONS: There were wide variations in the degree of gatekeeping between countries, with no simple binary model as to whether or not a country has a "PCP-as-gatekeeper" system. While there was case-by-case variation, there was no overall evidence of a link between a higher probability of initial consultation with a PCP and poorer cancer survival. KEY POINTS European cancer survival rates vary widely, and health system factors may account for some of these differences. The data from 14 European countries show a wide variation in the probability of initial presentation to a PCP. The degree to which PCPs act as gatekeepers varies considerably from country to country. There is no overall evidence of a link between a higher probability of initial presentation to a PCP and poorer cancer survival.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) promote tumour invasion and metastasis. We show that CAFs exert a physical force on cancer cells that enables their collective invasion. Force transmission is mediated by a heterophilic adhesion involving N-cadherin at the CAF membrane and E-cadherin at the cancer cell membrane. This adhesion is mechanically active; when subjected to force it triggers beta-catenin recruitment and adhesion reinforcement dependent on alpha-catenin/vinculin interaction. Impairment of E-cadherin/N-cadherin adhesion abrogates the ability of CAFs to guide collective cell migration and blocks cancer cell invasion. N-cadherin also mediates repolarization of the CAFs away from the cancer cells. In parallel, nectins and afadin are recruited to the cancer cell/CAF interface and CAF repolarization is afadin dependent. Heterotypic junctions between CAFs and cancer cells are observed in patient-derived material. Together, our findings show that a mechanically active heterophilic adhesion between CAFs and cancer cells enables cooperative tumour invasion.

Discriminating the contribution of unmodifiable random intrinsic DNA replication errors ('bad luck') to cancer development from those of other factors is critical for understanding cancer in humans and for directing public resources aimed at reducing the burden of cancer. Here, we review and highlight the evidence that demonstrates cancer causation is multifactorial, and provide several important examples where modification of risk factors has achieved cancer prevention. Furthermore, we stress the need and opportunities to advance understanding of cancer aetiology through integration of interaction effects between risk factors when estimating the contribution of individual and joint factors to cancer burden in a population. We posit that non-intrinsic factors drive most cancer risk, and stress the need for cancer prevention.

PURPOSE: Among cancer survivors, fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) is the most frequently reported unmet need. Despite this, research on psychosocial interventions that target FCR is limited. To address this gap, an individual cognitive-existential psychotherapy intervention for FCR was pilot tested via small-scale RCT. METHODS: Participants were recruited via study posters, healthcare professionals' referrals, and an electronic hospital database. Twenty-five female cancer survivors were randomized to experimental or wait-list control groups. Sessions included cognitive restructuring techniques, behavioral experiments, discussion of existential concerns, and relaxation exercises. Nineteen women completed the 6-week intervention and completed questionnaire packages at various time points. All participants completed self-administered questionnaires at pre-intervention (T1), post-intervention (T2), and at 3-month follow-up (T3). Participants in the control group also completed the same questionnaires, including at baseline (T0). RESULTS: Statistically significant results of between-within ANOVAs included time by condition interactions in the primary outcome measure of FCR and, for the experimental group participants, time by condition interactions in the secondary outcome measures of cancer-specific distress and uncertainty in illness. Statistically significant results of repeated measures ANOVAs included reductions in FCR, cancer-specific distress, uncertainty in illness, reassurance seeking, cognitive avoidance, and intolerance of uncertainty, as well as improvements in positive reinterpretation and growth, emotional coping, and quality of life (improved mental health), when compared to the control group. Most changes were maintained at 3-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This intervention responds to a need for evidence-based individual modality interventions targeting quality of life in cancer survivors. Our results demonstrate preliminary promising results in addressing FCR in female cancer survivors. Future research could seek to replicate results with a larger sample. Further research is needed to test this intervention with patients of mixed cancer sites.

Smoking is a major preventable cause of cancers and is increasingly concentrated among the most deprived individuals leading to increasing socioeconomic inequalities in the incidence of cancers linked to smoking. We aimed to estimate the tobacco-attributable cancer burden according to socioeconomic position in France. The analysis was restricted to cancer sites for which tobacco smoking was recognized as a risk factor. Cancer cases by sex, age group and European Deprivation Index (EDI) among people aged 30-74 between 2006 and 2009 were obtained from cancer registries covering approximately 20% of the French population. The tobacco-attributable burden of cancer according to EDI was estimated applying the population attributable fraction (PAF) computed with the Peto-Lopez method. The PAF increased from 56% in the least deprived EDI quintile to 70% in the most deprived EDI quintile among men and from 26% to 38% among women. In total, 28% of the excess cancer cases in the four most deprived EDI quintiles in men and 43% in women could be prevented if smoking in these 4 EDI quintiles was similar to that of the least deprived EDI quintile. A substantial smoking-attributable burden of cancer by socioeconomic position was observed in France. The results highlight the need for policies reducing tobacco consumption. More comprehensive interventions integrating the various dimensions of health determinants and proportionate according to socioeconomic position may essentially contribute to the reduction of socioeconomic inequalities in cancer.

Despite significant advances, most current in vivo models fail to fully recapitulate the biological processes that occur in humans. Here we aimed to develop an advanced humanized model with features of an organ bone by providing different bone tissue cellular compartments including preosteoblasts, mesenchymal stem/stromal (MSCs), endothelial and hematopoietic cells in an engineered microenvironment. The bone compartment was generated by culturing the human MSCs, umbilical vein endothelial cells with gelatin methacryloyl hydrogels in the center of a melt-electrospun polycaprolactone tubular scaffolds, which were seeded with human preosteoblasts. The tissue engineered bone (TEB) was subcutaneously implanted into the NSG mice and formed a morphologically and functionally organ bone. Mice were further humanized through the tail vein injection of human cord blood derived CD34+ cells, which then populated in the mouse bone marrow, spleen and humanized TEB (hTEB). 11 weeks after CD34+ transplantation, metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231BO) were orthotopically injected. Cancer cell injection resulted in the formation of a primary tumor and metastasis to the hTEB and mouse organs. Less frequent metastasis and lower tumor burden were observed in hematochimeric mice, suggesting an immune-mediated response against the breast cancer cells. Overall, our results demonstrate the efficacy of tissue engineering approaches to study species-specific cancer-bone interactions. Further studies using genetically modified hematopoietic stem cells and bioengineered microenvironments will enable us to address the specific roles of signaling molecules regulating hematopoietic niches and cancer metastasis in vivo.

BACKGROUND: Surgeon and hospital factors are associated with the survival of patients treated for rectal cancer. The relative contribution of each of these factors toward determining outcomes is poorly understood. METHODS: We used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results-Medicare database to analyze the outcomes of patients aged 65 years and older undergoing operative treatment for nonmetastatic rectal cancer, diagnosed in the United States between 1998 and 2007. These data were linked to a registry to identify whether the treating surgeon was a board-certified colorectal surgeon versus a noncolorectal surgeon. Hospital volume and hospital certification as a National Cancer Institute-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers were also analyzed. The primary outcome of interest was long-term survival. RESULTS: Our data source yielded 6432 patients. Initial analysis demonstrated improved long-term survival in patients treated by higher-volume colorectal surgeons, higher-volume hospitals, teaching hospitals, and National Cancer Institute (NCI)-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers. Based on an iterative approach to modeling the interactions between these various factors, we found a robust effect of surgeon subspecialty status, hospital volume, and NCI designation. Surgeon volume was not distinctly associated with long-term survival. CONCLUSIONS: Patients treated for rectal cancer by board-certified colorectal surgeons in centers that are higher volume and/or NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Centers experience better overall survival. These differences persist after adjustment for a broad range of patient and contextual risk factors, including surgeon volume. Patients and payers can use these results to identify surgeons and hospitals where outcomes are most favorable.

PURPOSE: Metabolic dysregulation has been implicated as a molecular driver of breast cancer in preclinical studies, especially with respect to metastases. We hypothesized that abnormalities in patient metabolism, such as obesity and diabetes, may drive outcomes in breast cancer patients with brain metastases. METHODS: We retrospectively identified 84 consecutive patients with brain metastases from breast cancer treated with intracranial radiation therapy. Radiation was delivered as whole-brain radiation to a median dose of 3000 cGy or stereotactic radiosurgery to a median dose of 2100 cGy. Kaplan Meier curves were generated for overall survival (OS) data and Mantel-Cox regression was performed to detect differences in groups. RESULTS: At analysis, 81 survival events had occurred and the median OS for the entire cohort was 21.7 months. Despite similar modified graded prognostic assessments, resection rates, and receptor status, BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2) (n = 45) was associated with decreased median OS (13.7 vs. 30.6 months; p < 0.001) and median intracranial progression-free survival (PFS) (7.4 vs. 10.9 months; p = 0.04) compared to patients with BMI < 25 kg/m(2) (n = 39). Similar trends were observed among all three types of breast cancer. Patients with diabetes (n = 17) had decreased median OS (11.8 vs. 26.2 months; p < 0.001) and median intracranial PFS (4.5 vs. 10.3 months; p = 0.001) compared to non-diabetics (n = 67). On multivariate analysis, both BMI >/= 25 kg/m(2) [HR 2.35 (1.39-3.98); p = 0.002] and diabetes [HR 2.77 (1.454-5.274); p = 0.002] were associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated BMI or diabetes may negatively impact both overall survival and local control in patients with brain metastases from breast cancer, highlighting the importance of the translational development of therapeutic metabolic interventions. Given its prognostic significance, BMI should be used as a stratification in future clinical trial design in this patient population.

BACKGROUND: Patient navigation is a promising intervention to address cancer disparities but requires a multisite controlled trial to assess its effectiveness. METHODS: The Patient Navigation Research Program compared patient navigation with usual care on time to diagnosis or treatment for participants with breast, cervical, colorectal, or prostate screening abnormalities and/or cancers between 2007 and 2010. Patient navigators developed individualized strategies to address barriers to care, with the focus on preventing delays in care. To assess timeliness of diagnostic resolution, we conducted a meta-analysis of center- and cancer-specific adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) comparing patient navigation vs usual care. To assess initiation of cancer therapy, we calculated a single aHR, pooling data across all centers and cancer types. We conducted a metaregression to evaluate variability across centers. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: The 10521 participants with abnormal screening tests and 2105 with a cancer or precancer diagnosis were predominantly from racial/ethnic minority groups (73%) and publically insured (40%) or uninsured (31%). There was no benefit during the first 90 days of care, but a benefit of navigation was seen from 91 to 365 days for both diagnostic resolution (aHR = 1.51; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.23 to 1.84; P < .001)) and treatment initiation (aHR = 1.43; 95% CI = 1.10 to 1.86; P < .007). Metaregression revealed that navigation had its greatest benefits within centers with the greatest delays in follow-up under usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Patient navigation demonstrated a moderate benefit in improving timely cancer care. These results support adoption of patient navigation in settings that serve populations at risk of being lost to follow-up.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Detection of metastatic tumor cells is important for early diagnosis and staging of cancer. However, such cells are exceedingly difficult to detect from blood or biopsy samples at the disease onset. It is reported that cancer cells, and especially metastatic tumor cells, show very distinctive morphological behavior compared to their healthy counterparts on aptamer functionalized substrates. The ability to quickly analyze the data and quantify the cell morphology for an instant real-time feedback can certainly contribute to early cancer diagnosis. A supervised machine learning approach is presented for identification and classification of cancer cell gestures for early diagnosis. METHODS: We quantified the morphologically distinct behavior of metastatic cells and their healthy counterparts captured on aptamer-functionalized glass substrates from time-lapse optical micrographs. As a proof of concept, the morphologies of human glioblastoma (hGBM) and astrocyte cells were used. The cells were captured and imaged with an optical microscope. Multiple feature vectors were extracted to quantify and differentiate the complex physical gestures of cancerous and non-cancerous cells. Three different classifier models, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Tree (RFT), and Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) were trained with the known dataset using machine learning algorithms. The performances of the classifiers were compared for accuracy, precision, and recall measurements using five-fold cross-validation technique. RESULTS: All the classifier models detected the cancer cells with an average accuracy of at least 82%. The NBC performed the best among the three classifiers in terms of Precision (0.91), Recall (0.9), and F1-score (0.89) for the existing dataset. CONCLUSIONS: This paper presents a standalone system built on machine learning techniques for cancer screening based on cell gestures. The system offers rapid, efficient, and novel identification of hGBM brain tumor cells and can be extended to define single cell analysis metrics for many other types of tumor cells.

The National Comprehensive Cancer Control Program has experienced exponential growth over the past 20 years due to the coordination and collaboration of many stakeholders to sustain multisector coalitions, develop and execute data-driven plans, and successfully implement evidenced-based interventions across the United States. These stakeholders have worked tirelessly to address the burden of cancer by employing strategies that promote healthy behaviors to reduce cancer risk, facilitate screening, and address the needs of cancer survivors. The interaction between the comprehensive cancer control program and the coalitions to engage in this work has been coined the 3Ps: the partnership, the CCC plan, and CCC program interventions. This article describes the efforts to evaluate the growth of the comprehensive cancer control movement, especially as it pertains to coalition contribution, plan priority development and implementation, and intervention implementation. It describes successes and lessons learned from an evaluation whose findings can be used to bolster and sustain comprehensive cancer control programs and coalitions across the U.S.

The predominant cause of cancer mortality is metastasis. The major impediment to cancer cure is the intrinsic or acquired resistance to currently available therapies. Cancer is heterogeneous at the genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic levels. And, while a molecular-targeted drug may be pathway-precise, it can still fail to achieve wholesome cancer-precise toxicity. In the current review, we discuss the strategic differences between targeting the strengths of cancer cells in phenotypic plasticity and heterogeneity and targeting shared vulnerabilities of cancer cells such as the compromised integrity of membranous organelles. To better recapitulate subpopulations of cancer cells in different phenotypic and functional states, we developed a schematic combination of 2-dimensional culture (2D), 3-dimmensional culture in collagen I (3D), and mammosphere culture for stem cells (mammosphere), designated as Scheme 2D/3D/mammosphere. We investigated how the tumor suppressor maspin may limit carcinoma cell plasticity and affect their context-dependent response to drugs of different mechanisms including docetaxel, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor MS-275, and ionophore antibiotic salinomycin. We showed that tumor cell phenotypic plasticity is not an exclusive attribute to cancer stem cells. Nonetheless, three subpopulations of prostate cancer cells, enriched through Scheme 2D/3D/mammosphere, show qualitatively different drug responses. Interestingly, salinomycin was the only drug that effectively killed all three cancer cell subpopulations, irrespective of their capacity of stemness. Further, Scheme 2D/3D/mammosphere may be a useful model to accelerate the screening for curative cancer drugs while avoiding costly characterization of compounds that may have only selective toxicity to some, but not all, cancer cell subpopulations.

OBJECTIVES: Cancer-related fatigue and fear of recurrence (FOR) are the most common symptoms in cancer survivors and severely affect quality of life (QOL). This study aims to promote and evaluate the effectiveness of physical and psychological rehabilitation activities for cancer survivors. METHODS: A longitudinal study with an interventional research design was conducted. A total of 80 participants were randomly assigned to experimental groups E1 (Qigong exercise [QE]) or E2 (stress management [SM]) or the control group. The E1 and E2 groups received QE and SM, respectively, as interventions once a week for 12 weeks, and effects were assessed. Cancer-related fatigue, FOR, QOL, and heart rate variability (HRV) were evaluated at baseline (T0), after 12 weeks (T1), and at the 3-month follow-up (T2). RESULTS: QE and SM effectively strengthened the physical and psychological functions of cancer survivors at the T1 phase. Although differences in FOR and QOL were not statistically significant, the scores were decreased and increased, respectively. Although the effects during the T2 phase were not as significant as those during T1, the score progress was maintained. The effects on HRV were significantly different among the E1, E2, and control groups at T1, which shows that the performance of both experimental groups was better than that of the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Physical and psychological rehabilitation activities should be practiced periodically and should be led by professional staff. Long-term educational resources and care should also be provided. HRV can be used to efficiently monitor the status of the mind-body balance and is a more suitable index than questionnaires for physical and psychological function evaluation in cancer survivors.

Most tumors exhibit intra-tumor heterogeneity, which is associated with disease progression and an impaired response to therapy. Cancer cell plasticity has been proposed as being an important mechanism that, along with genetic and epigenetic alterations, promotes cancer cell diversity and contributes to intra-tumor heterogeneity. Plasticity endows cancer cells with the capacity to shift dynamically between a differentiated state, with limited tumorigenic potential, and an undifferentiated or cancer stem-like cell (CSC) state, which is responsible for long-term tumor growth. In addition, it confers the ability to transit into distinct CSC states with different competence to invade, disseminate and seed metastasis. Cancer cell plasticity has been linked to the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition program and relies not only on cell-autonomous mechanisms, but also on signals provided by the tumor microenvironment and/or induced in response to therapy. We provide an overview of the dynamic transition for cancer cell states, the mechanisms governing cell plasticity and their impact on tumor progression, metastasis and therapy response. Understanding the mechanisms involved in cancer cell plasticity will provide insights for establishing new therapeutic interventions.

Cancer survival is an important indicator for quality of cancer care. We sought to determine if there are differences in cancer survival between immigrants and the host population in Norway. We performed a nationwide registry-based study comprising subjects diagnosed with cancer between 1990 and 2014, and followed until the end of 2016. Survival was estimated for 13 cancer sites with cause-specific survival. Adjustments were made for common confounders (age, sex, year of diagnosis and place of residence) and defined mediators (stage at diagnosis, comorbidity and socioeconomic factors). A total of 500,255 subjects were available for analysis, of which 11,252 were Western and 8,701 non-Western immigrants. We did not find differences in cancer survival between Western immigrants and Norwegians, while non-Western immigrants, with some exceptions, had similar or better survival. Better lung cancer survival in non-Western immigrants than Norwegians was notable (hazard ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.78 (0.71-0.85)), and not explained by defined mediators. Immigrants from Eastern Europe and Balkan with melanoma (hazard ratio: 1.54 (1.12-2.12)) and prostate cancer (hazard ratio: 1.34 (1.08-1.67)), and possibly from sub-Saharan Africa with breast cancer (hazard ratio: 1.41 (0.94-2.12)) had worse survival than Norwegians. The results suggest that immigrants in Norway have good cancer survival relative to the host population. Poor survival in immigrants from Eastern Europe and Balkan with melanoma and prostate cancer, and sub-Saharan Africa with breast cancer might be a concern.

INTRODUCTION: Adolescents and young adults (AYAs) diagnosed with cancer between ages 15-39 years may harbour germline variants associated with cancer predisposition. Such variants represent putative therapeutic targets, as may somatic variants in the tumour. Germline and tumour molecular profiling is increasingly utilised to facilitate personalisation of cancer treatment in such individuals. AIM: Considering AYAs with advanced solid tumours managed in a specialist drug development unit (DDU), the aims of this study were to investigate the use and impact of: 1. Germline genetic assessment. 2. Tumour molecular profiling. METHODS: AYAs treated in the DDU at the Royal Marsden Hospital between 2002 and 2016 were identified from departmental databases. Data regarding clinicopathological features, clinical assessments and germline and tumour genetic testing were retrieved by chart review. RESULTS: The study cohort included 219 AYAs. Common cancer types included sarcoma (41, 19%); cervical (27, 12%); breast (25, 11%); ovarian (23, 11%) and colorectal (21, 10%) cancers. Germline testing was undertaken in 34 (16%) patients, 22 of whom carried a pathogenic variant. Using current testing criteria, an additional 32 (15%) would be eligible for germline testing based on their personal history of cancer alone. Tumour testing was undertaken in 46 (21%) individuals. Somatic mutations were commonly identified in TP53 13 (28%); PIK3CA (8, 18%); KRAS (4, 9%) and MET 5 (11%). DISCUSSION: A significant proportion of AYAs with advanced cancer have targetable somatic or germline mutations. Consideration of familial risk factors and inclusion of germline testing wherever appropriate can complement tumour testing to optimise patient management and inform management of at-risk relatives.

Podoplanin (PDPN) is a transmembrane receptor glycoprotein that is upregulated on transformed cells, cancer associated fibroblasts and inflammatory macrophages that contribute to cancer progression. In particular, PDPN increases tumor cell clonal capacity, epithelial mesenchymal transition, migration, invasion, metastasis and inflammation. Antibodies, CAR-T cells, biologics and synthetic compounds that target PDPN can inhibit cancer progression and septic inflammation in preclinical models. This review describes recent advances in how PDPN may be used as a biomarker and therapeutic target for many types of cancer, including glioma, squamous cell carcinoma, mesothelioma and melanoma.

PURPOSE: Relevant animal models of human breast cancer are currently needed, especially for the aggressive triple-negative breast cancer subtype. Recent studies and our results (Part 1) indicate that spontaneous canine invasive mammary carcinomas (CMCs) resemble human breast cancer by clinics and pathology as well as behavior and prognostic indicators. We hypothesized that the current molecular classifications of human breast cancer, used for therapeutic decision, could be relevant to dogs. METHODS: Three hundred and fifty female dogs with spontaneous CMC and a 2-year follow-up were retrospectively included. By immunohistochemistry, CMCs were classified according to Nielsen (Clin Cancer Res 10:5367-5374, 2004) and Blows (PlosOne doi: 10.1371/journal.pmed.1000279, 2010) into the subtypes of human breast cancer. RESULTS: Four immunophenotypes were defined either according to Nielsen classification (luminal A 14.3%, luminal B 9.4%, triple-negative basal-like 58.6%, and triple-negative nonbasal-like 17.7% CMCs); or to Blows classification (luminal 1-: 11.4%, luminal 1+: 12.3%, Core basal phenotype: 58.6%, and five-negative phenotype: 17.7%). No HER2-overexpressing CMC as defined by a 3 + immunohistochemical score was observed in our cohort. By univariate and multivariate analyses, both immunophenotypical classifications applied to CMCs showed strong prognostic significance: luminal A or luminal 1+ CMCs showed a significantly longer disease-free interval (HR = 0.46), Overall (HR = 0.47), and Specific Survival (HR = 0.56) compared to triple-negative carcinomas, after adjustment for stage. CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, triple-negative CMCs largely predominated (76%), were much more prevalent than in human beings, and showed an aggressive natural behavior after mastectomy. Dogs are thus potent valuable spontaneous models to test new therapeutic strategies for this particular subtype of breast cancer.

The rs937283 variant, locating in murine double minute 2 promoter region, has been previously reported to potentially alter the promoter activity and to influence cancer susceptibility. In this study, we investigated the association of murine double minute 2 rs937283 variant and cancer susceptibility in a central Chinese population, followed by a meta-analysis. A total of 1058 healthy controls, 480 patients with breast cancer, 384 patients with cervical cancer, 480 patients with liver cancer, 426 patients with colon cancer, and 361 patients with rectal cancer were recruited in this case-control study. The murine double minute 2 rs937283 was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism and confirmed by sequencing. Our case-control analysis revealed that rs937283 was associated with the susceptibility to breast and liver cancer, but not cervical, colon, or rectal cancer. Specifically, the G allele of rs937283 conferred a significantly increased risk of breast and liver cancer. Moreover, results of meta-analysis demonstrated that rs937283 was significantly associated with cancer susceptibility, and this significant association remained in Asian (Chinese) population, but not in Caucasian population. Collectively, the murine double minute 2 rs937283 variant may serve as a potential biomarker for cancer predisposition in Chinese population.

To investigate the effect of distant metastases sites on survival in patients with de novo stage-IV breast cancer. From 2010 to 2013, patients with a diagnosis of de novo stage-IV breast cancer were identified using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to analyze the effect of distant metastases sites on breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival. A total of 7575 patients were identified. The most common metastatic sites were bone, followed by lung, liver, and brain. Patients with hormone receptor+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- and hormone receptor+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ status were more prone to bone metastases. Lung and brain metastases were common in hormone receptor-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ and hormone receptor-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- subtypes, and patients with hormone receptor+/ human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ and hormone receptor-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ subtypes were more prone to liver metastases. Patients with liver and brain metastases had unfavorable prognosis for breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival, whereas bone and lung metastases had no effect on patient survival in multivariate analyses. The hormone receptor-/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- subtype conferred a significantly poorer outcome in terms of breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival. hormone receptor+/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2+ disease was associated with the best prognosis in terms of breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival. Patients with liver and brain metastases were more likely to experience poor prognosis for breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival by various breast cancer subtypes. Distant metastases sites have differential impact on clinical outcomes in stage-IV breast cancer. Follow-up screening for brain and liver metastases might be effective in improving breast cancer-specific survival and overall survival.

BACKGROUND: Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for localized prostate cancer involves high-dose-per-fraction radiation treatments. Its use is increasing, but concerns remain about treatment-related toxicity. The authors assessed the incidence and predictors of a global decline in health-related quality of life (HRQOL) after prostate SBRT. METHODS: From 2008 to 2014, 713 consecutive men with localized prostate cancer received treatment with SBRT according to a prospective institutional protocol. Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite (EPIC-26) HRQOL data were collected at baseline and longitudinally for 5 years. EPIC-26 is comprised of 5 domains. The primary endpoint was defined as a decline exceeding the clinically detectable threshold in >/=4 EPIC-26 domains, termed multidomain decline. RESULTS: The median age was 69 years, 46% of patients had unfavorable intermediate-risk or high-risk disease, and 20% received androgen-deprivation therapy. During 1 to 3 months and 6 to 60 months after SBRT, 8% to 15% and 10% to 11% of patients had multidomain declines, respectively. On multivariable analysis, lower baseline bowel HRQOL (odds ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.2-2.7; P < .01) and baseline depression (odds ratio, 5.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.3-24.3; P = .02) independently predicted for multidomain decline. Only 3% to 4% of patients had long-term multidomain declines exceeding twice the clinical threshold, and 30% of such declines appeared to be related to prostate cancer treatment or progression of disease. CONCLUSIONS: Prostate SBRT has minimal long-term impact on multidomain decline, and the majority of more significant multidomain declines appear to be unrelated to treatment. This emphasizes the importance of focusing not only on the side effects of prostate cancer treatment but also on other comorbid illnesses that contribute to overall HRQOL. Cancer 2017;123:1635-1642.

BACKGROUND: Previous studies have reported changes in the body mass index (BMI) with time in childhood cancer survivors (CCSs) during follow-up. The limitations of these studies include that they described only a subgroup of survivors or used questionnaires with self-reported heights and weights. The goal of this study was to examine BMI in a large cohort of long-term CCSs and relate this to the BMI at diagnosis, age, sex, tumor type, treatment, and endocrine defects. METHODS: All patients treated for childhood cancer at the Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Center between 1966 and 1996 who had survived for at least 5 years were eligible for inclusion. For 893 CCSs with a mean follow-up of 14.9 years, the BMI at the late effects outpatient clinic was compared with the BMI for the general Dutch population. RESULTS: For girls, an increased prevalence of obesity was found. Risk factors for developing a high BMI at follow-up were a younger age and a high BMI at diagnosis and treatment with cranial radiotherapy. A significantly increased prevalence of severe underweight was found in all adult subgroups except for females aged 26 to 45 years. An association was found between a low BMI at diagnosis and a low BMI at follow-up. No treatment-related variables could be related to changes in BMI. CONCLUSIONS: The BMI at diagnosis is one of the most important predictors for the BMI at follow-up, and this suggests an important genetic or environmental cause. Adult CCSs are at high risk for developing severe underweight at follow-up. Future studies should focus on the causes and clinical consequences of underweight.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the third most common malignancy and the second-leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Large multi-omic databases, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas and the International Colorectal Cancer Subtyping Consortium, have identified distinct molecular subtypes related to anatomy. The identification of genomic alterations in CRC is now critical because of the recent success and US Food and Drug Administration approval of pembrolizumab and nivolumab for microsatellite-instable tumors. In parallel, landmark studies have established the prognostic significance of the CRC tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte and the clinical impact of the tumor immune microenvironment. As a result, there is a growing appreciation for immunogenomics, the interconnected relation between tumor genomics and the immune microenvironment. The clinical implications of CRC immunogenomics continue to expand, and it will likely serve as a guide for next-generation immunotherapy strategies for improving outcomes for this disease.

BACKGROUND: Data on the characteristics of patients who are likely to experience adverse events, both immune-related and non-immune-related, from programmed cell death-1 (PD1) inhibitors are limited. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from patients who received >/=1 dose of single-agent PD1 inhibitor between August 3, 2011 and August 31, 2016 were obtained from our Institution's pharmacy database. AEs were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4. RESULTS: One hundred and eighty-two patients received at least one dose of single-agent PD1 inhibitor prior to data cut-off. After excluding 14 patients with uncommon malignancies, the total number of patients were 168. The median age was 63 (range=24-92) years. There were 87 (52%) cases of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), 35 (21%) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), 12 (7%) of melanoma, 18 (11%) of Hodgkin's lymphomas, eight (5%) of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and eight (5%) of small cell lung cancer. Considering grade 2 or more AEs, 30 (18%) patients had kidney injury, 34 (20%) hypothyroidism, 36 (21%) transaminitis, 20 (12%) pneumonitis, and 18 (11%) colitis. Patients with RCC had higher odds of experiencing grade 2 or more kidney injury than patients with other primary tumor types (adjusted p=0.025), whereas patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and HNSCC had higher odds of grade 2 hypothyroidism (adjusted p=0.005). Patients with NSCLC had higher risk of death with pneumonitis than those whose primary cancer was not NSCLC (adjusted p=0.005). DISCUSSION: The increased odds of patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma and HNSCC experiencing grade 2 or more hypothyroidism may be related to previous radiation exposure. Most patients with RCC had undergone nephrectomy, making them more susceptible to acute kidney injury. When pneumonitis occurred in patients with primary NSCLC, the overall survival was significantly worse. The duration of PD1 therapy was significantly associated with onset of pneumonitis (p=0.007). CONCLUSION: The site of primary tumor or metastasis may help predict the most common AEs in patients treated with PD1 inhibitors.

Background: Beliefs about cancer risk and experience of early detection and treatment can impact on willingness to engage with these initiatives. This study describes changes in perceptions of cancer mortality, early detection and treatment among adult New Zealanders (NZ) between two cross-sectional studies conducted in 2001 and 2014/5. Methods: Data was collected via telephone interviews conducted by trained interviewers in 2001 (231 females and 207 males, 64% response rate) and 2014/5 (588 females and 476 males, 64% response rate). Participants were asked to identify the most common three causes of cancer mortality among women and then men. They were also asked to note their agreement or otherwise with statements about early detection and treatment of cancer. Results: There was an increase in proportions of men who correctly identified prostate cancer as one of the top three causes of cancer mortality among men, and also an increase among women who correctly identified bowel cancer as one of the top three. Most participants agreed that there were benefits from early detection for cancer outcomes. Over time, there was a significant decline in proportions which felt that most cancer treatment is "so terrible it is worse than death" and that alternative therapy has an "equal or better chance of curing cancer." Conclusion: Internationally, there is little information available about changes in cancer perceptions over time, these findings suggest some changes in perceptions of treatment and awareness of types of cancer with the highest mortality in NZ, which should support timely engagement with early detection and treatment services.

Current anticancer paradigms largely target driver mutations considered integral for cancer cell survival and tumor progression. Although initially successful, many of these strategies are unable to overcome the tremendous heterogeneity that characterizes advanced tumors, resulting in the emergence of resistant disease. Cancer is a rapidly evolving, multifactorial disease that accumulates numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations. This results in wide phenotypic and molecular heterogeneity within the tumor, the complexity of which is further amplified through specific interactions between cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. In this context, cancer may be perceived as an "ecomolecular" disease that involves cooperation between several neoplastic clones and their interactions with immune cells, stromal fibroblasts, and other cell types present in the microenvironment. This collaboration is mediated by a variety of secreted factors. Cancer is therefore analogous to complex ecosystems such as microbial consortia. In the present article, we comment on the current paradigms and perspectives guiding the development of cancer diagnostics and therapeutics and the potential application of systems biology to untangle the complexity of neoplasia. In our opinion, conceptualization of neoplasia as an ecomolecular disease is warranted. Advances in knowledge pertinent to the complexity and dynamics of interactions within the cancer ecosystem are likely to improve understanding of tumor etiology, pathogenesis, and progression. This knowledge is anticipated to facilitate the design of new and more effective therapeutic approaches that target the tumor ecosystem in its entirety.

BACKGROUND: Cytopathology is a noninvasive and cost-effective method for detecting cancer cells in pleural effusions (PEs), although in many cases, the diagnostic performance is hindered by the paucity of significant cells or the lack of clear morphological criteria. This study presents the results of an omics approach to improving the diagnostic performance of PE cytology. METHODS: Metabolic profiling with proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1) H-NMR) was performed for 92 PEs (44 malignant cases of 8 different cancers and 48 benign cases of 7 nonneoplastic conditions). Light's criteria were used to further classify PEs as transudates or exudates, and (1) H-NMR spectroscopy was used to differentiate malignant pleural effusions (mPEs) from benign pleural effusions (bPEs). RESULTS: (1) H-NMR metabolic analysis showed clearly different spectra for mPEs and bPEs in the regions of the signals due to lipids, branched amino acids, and lactate, which were increased in mPEs. Transudates and exudates in bPEs were differentiated as well on the basis of the (1) H-NMR signals from lipids and lipoproteins, which were increased in exudates. CONCLUSIONS: Subject to validation in further larger studies, (1) H-NMR metabonomics could be an effective and reliable ancillary tool for PE investigations and diagnoses.

BACKGROUND: There is significant need for quality follow-up care to optimize long-term outcomes for the growing population of lower gastrointestinal (GI) cancer survivors. Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) provide valuable information regarding late and long-term effects (LLTEs). METHODS: A convenience sample from 1129 colon, rectal, and anal cancer survivors (n = 792; 218, and 119, respectively) who participated in an Internet-based survivorship care plan (SCP) tool between May 2010 and October 2014 was used to examine patient-reported demographics, treatment, and toxicity data. Responses from a follow-up survey were reviewed. RESULTS: The median age of diagnosis was 51 years, and 81% of survivors were Caucasian. The most commonly reported LLTEs for all survivors were neuropathy, fatigue, cognitive changes, changes in GI function, urogenital and sexual dysfunction, and dermatologic effects. The prevalence of these effects varied with time since diagnosis, treatment modality, and treatment center. Individuals who had survived anal cancer reported a high prevalence of sexual dysfunction and radiation-induced dermatologic effects. Over 87% of users reported satisfaction levels of good to excellent using the SCP tool, and 69% reported that they intend to share the SCP with their health care team. CONCLUSIONS: For lower GI cancer survivors, it is feasible to obtain PROs from an Internet-based survivorship tool. Survivors report a wide spectrum of LLTEs, and these can be used to inform counseling at the time of diagnosis and to help anticipate and respond to disease-related and treatment-related sequelae during follow-up. The authors are among the first to report on PROs in anal cancer survivors. Further investigation on the impact of SCPs on health care communication and use is needed. Cancer 2017;123:1860-1868.

BACKGROUND: Postoperative management of prostate cancer with lymph node involvement (LNI) is controversial. Retrospective evidence supports the selective use of radiotherapy (RT) after extended pelvic lymph node dissection. It is unclear whether this is generalizable to practice in the United States, where extended dissection is uncommon. The authors identified patients with LNI who potentially could derive a survival benefit with adjuvant RT plus androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). METHODS: Patients with N1M0 prostate adenocarcinoma who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) and subsequently received ADT from 2003 through 2011 were identified from the National Cancer Database. Kaplan-Meier analyses, log-rank tests, and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression were performed using overall survival (OS) as the primary outcome. RESULTS: In total, 906 of 2569 eligible patients (35.3%) received RT, and RT was more frequently received by patients who were diagnosed in later years, had fewer positive lymph nodes, had involved surgical margins, and were aged <65 years (all P < .05). The 5-year OS rate was 87% versus 82% in those who received RT versus those who did not (P = .007). After propensity score matching, 826 patients remained in each cohort. RT retained an association with OS (5-year OS: 88% vs 81%; P = .009; hazard ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.86; P = .008). No interaction was identified between the effect of RT on OS across tested strata of total lymph nodes examined, lymph node ratio, total number of positive lymph nodes, margin status, Gleason score, and prostate-specific antigen. CONCLUSIONS: RT plus ADT was associated with improved OS after RP in patients with LNI. These results may help guide therapy in the absence of randomized evidence. Cancer 2017;123:512-520.

BACKGROUND: Stage is a key predictor of cancer survival. Complete cancer staging is vital for understanding outcomes at population level and monitoring the efficacy of early diagnosis initiatives. Cancer registries usually collect details of the disease extent but staging information may be missing because a stage was never assigned to a patient or because it was not included in cancer registration records. Missing stage information introduce methodological difficulties for analysis and interpretation of results. We describe the associations between missing stage and socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients diagnosed with colon, lung or breast cancer in England in 2013. We assess how these associations change when completeness is high, and administrative issues are assumed to be minimal. We estimate the amount of avoidable missing stage data if high levels of completeness reached by some Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs), were achieved nationally. METHODS: Individual cancer records were retrieved from the National Cancer Registration and linked to the Routes to Diagnosis and Hospital Episode Statistics datasets to obtain additional clinical information. We used multivariable beta binomial regression models to estimate the strength of the association between socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients and missing stage and to derive the amount of avoidable missing stage. RESULTS: Multivariable modelling showed that old age was associated with missing stage irrespective of the cancer site and independent of comorbidity score, short-term mortality and patient characteristics. This remained true for patients in the CCGs with high completeness. Applying the results from these CCGs to the whole cohort showed that approximately 70% of missing stage information was potentially avoidable. CONCLUSIONS: Missing stage was more frequent in older patients, including those residing in CCGs with high completeness. This disadvantage for older patients was not explained fully by the presence of comorbidity. A substantial gain in completeness could have been achieved if administrative practices were improved to the level of the highest performing areas. Reasons for missing stage information should be carefully assessed before any study, and potential distortions introduced by how missing stage is handled should be considered in order to draw the most correct inference from available statistics.

PURPOSE: Childhood cancer survivors (CCS) report high unmet information needs. This study examined the prevalence of cancer-related information-seeking among CCS and investigated associations between information-seeking behavior and positive health outcomes such as follow-up care. METHODS: Participants (n = 193) were young adult CCS diagnosed with cancer in Los Angeles County, 54% of Hispanic ethnicity, with a mean age of 19.87, in remission, and at least 2 years from completion of treatment. CCS were asked where they accessed health information related to their cancer with response options categorized into four information domains: hospital resources, social media, other survivors, and family members. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess variables associated with each information domain, including sociodemographics, post-traumatic growth (i.e., reporting positive changes since cancer diagnosis), health care engagement, level of education, and health insurance status. RESULTS: Hospital resources were the most commonly accessed information domain (65.3%), and CCS of Hispanic ethnicity (vs. non-Hispanic) were more likely to access this source. Seeking information from other cancer survivors was positively associated with follow-up care and post-traumatic growth. Hispanic CCS were marginally less likely to seek information from other survivors and family than non-Hispanics. CONCLUSIONS: While CCS obtain information from a variety of sources, hospital resources are an important site for access, particularly for individuals of Hispanic ethnicity. Information sharing between survivors may promote positive health care engagement; however, Hispanic CCS may be less likely to utilize this resource and may face barriers in information sharing with other cancer survivors.

PURPOSE: In the presence of interferon, proteasome subunits are replaced by their inducible counterparts to form an immunoproteasome (IP) plays a key role in generation of antigenic peptides presented by MHC class I molecules, leading to elicitation of a T cellmediated immune response. Although the roles of IP in other cancers, and inflammatory diseases have been extensively studied, its significance in breast cancer is unclear. Materials and Methods: We investigated the expression of LMP7, an IP subunit, and its relationship with immune system components in two breast cancer cohorts. RESULTS: In 668 consecutive breast cancer cohort, 40% of tumors showed high level of LMP7 expression, and tumors with high expression of LMP7 had more tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in each subtype of breast cancer. In another cohort of 681 triple-negative breast cancer patients cohort, the expression of LMP7 in tumor cells was significantly correlated with the amount of TILs and the expression of interferon-associated molecules (MxA [p < 0.001] and PKR [p < 0.001]), endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated molecules (PERK [p=0.012], p-eIF2a [p=0.001], and XBP1 [p < 0.001]), and damage-associated molecular patterns (HMGN1 [p < 0.001] and HMGB1 [p < 0.001]). Patients with higher LMP7 expression had better disease-free survival outcomes than those with no or low expression in the positive lymph node metastasis group (p=0.041). CONCLUSION: Close association between the TIL levels and LMP7 expression in breast cancer indicates that better antigen presentation through greater LMP7 expression might be associated with more TILs.

BACKGROUND: Inherited predisposition to pancreatic cancer contributes significantly to its incidence and presents an opportunity for the development of early detection strategies. The genetic basis of predisposition remains unexplained in a high proportion of patients with familial PC (FPC). METHODS: Clinicopathologic features were assessed in a cohort of 766 patients who had been diagnosed with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PC). Patients were classified with FPC if they had >/=1 affected first-degree relatives; otherwise, they were classified with sporadic PC (SPC). RESULTS: The prevalence of FPC in this cohort was 8.9%. In FPC families with an affected parent-child pair, 71% in the subsequent generation were 12.3 years younger at diagnosis. Patients with FPC had more first-degree relatives who had an extrapancreatic malignancy (EPM) (42.6% vs 21.2; P<.0001), particularly melanoma and endometrial cancer, but not a personal history of EPM. Patients with SPC were more likely to be active smokers, have higher cumulative tobacco exposure, and have fewer multifocal precursor lesions, but these were not associated with differences in survival. Long-standing diabetes mellitus (>2 years) was associated with poor survival in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: FPC represents 9% of PC, and the risk of malignancy in kindred does not appear to be confined to the pancreas. Patients with FPC have more precursor lesions and include fewer active smokers, but other clinicopathologic factors and outcome are similar to those in patients with SPC. Furthermore, some FPC kindreds may exhibit anticipation. A better understanding of the clinical features of PC will facilitate efforts to uncover novel susceptibility genes and the development of early detection strategies.

Answer questions and earn CME/CNE A measles outbreak originating in California during 2014 and 2015 called attention to the potential for infectious disease outbreaks related to underimmunized populations in the United States and the potential risk to pediatric patients with cancer attending school when such outbreaks occur. Compliance with vaccine recommendations is important for the prevention of hepatitis B-related and human papillomavirus-related cancers and for protecting immunocompromised patients with cancer, and these points are often overlooked, resulting in the continued occurrence of vaccine-preventable neoplastic and infectious diseases and complications. This article provides an overview of the importance of vaccines in the context of cancer and encourages clinician, health system, and public policy efforts to promote adherence to immunization recommendations in the United States.

BACKGROUND: For patients with resectable gastric adenocarcinoma, perioperative chemotherapy and adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (CRT) are considered standard options. In the current study, the authors used the National Cancer Data Base to compare overall survival (OS) between these regimens. METHODS: Patients who underwent gastrectomy for nonmetastatic gastric adenocarcinoma from 2004 through 2012 were divided into those treated with perioperative chemotherapy without RT versus those treated with adjuvant CRT. Survival was estimated and compared using univariate and multivariate models adjusted for patient and tumor characteristics, surgical margin status, and the number of lymph nodes examined. Subset analyses were performed for factors chosen a priori, and potential interactions between treatment and covariates were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 3656 eligible patients were identified, 52% of whom underwent perioperative chemotherapy and 48% of whom received postoperative CRT. The median follow-up was 47 months, and the median age of the patients was 62 years. Analysis of the entire cohort demonstrated improved OS with adjuvant RT on both univariate (median of 51 months vs 42 months; P = .013) and multivariate (hazard ratio, 0.874; 95% confidence interval, 0.790-0.967 [P = .009]) analyses. Propensity score-matched analysis also demonstrated improved OS with adjuvant RT (median of 49 months vs 39 months; P = .033). On subset analysis, a significant interaction was observed between the survival impact of adjuvant RT and surgical margins, with a greater benefit of RT noted among patients with surgical margin-positive disease (hazard ratio with RT: 0.650 vs 0.952; P for interaction <.001). CONCLUSIONS: In this National Cancer Data Base analysis, the use of adjuvant RT in addition to chemotherapy was associated with a significant OS advantage for patients with resected gastric cancer. The survival advantage observed with adjuvant CRT was most pronounced among patients with positive surgical margins. Cancer 2017;123:3402-9. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

BACKGROUND: The role of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) in locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) is uncertain after multiple randomized clinical trials have yielded mixed results. The authors used the National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) to determine whether CRT yields a survival benefit compared with chemotherapy alone (CT). METHODS: Patients with nonmetastatic LAPC diagnosed during 2004 through 2014 were identified in the NCDB. Patients who received CT were compared with those who received CRT using chi-square analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to compare demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics that were predictive of survival. Propensity score matching and shared frailty analysis were done. Subgroup analyses were undertaken to examine patients who underwent pancreatectomy and cohorts of patients who received different CT or CRT regimens. RESULTS: In total, 8689 patients with LAPC were identified. CRT was associated with improved survival (median survival [MS], 13.5 months) compared with CT (MS, 10.6 months) on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; P < .001). Induction chemotherapy before CRT (HR, 0.67; P < .001) and multiagent chemotherapy (HR, 0.72; P < .001) were also identified as independent predictors of survival compared with concurrent CRT and single-agent CT, respectively. Patients in the CRT group who received multiagent induction chemotherapy had superior MS and pancreatectomy rates (MS, 17.5 months; HR, 0.70; P < .001; pancreatectomy rate, 10%) compared with those who received multiagent CT alone (MS, 12.4 months; pancreatectomy rate, 3.3%). Patients who underwent pancreatectomy experienced improved survival (MS, 22 vs 10.6 months; HR, 0.39; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: In this NCDB analysis, maximizing systemic chemotherapy before CRT improved survival compared with CT alone in patients with LAPC. Continued analysis of CRT in properly selected patients after maximized systemic therapy is needed. Cancer 2017;123:3816-24. (c) 2017 American Cancer Society.

Despite great improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of neoplasms, metastatic disease is still the leading cause of death in cancer patients, with mortality rates still rising. Given this background, new ways to treat cancer will be important for development of improved cancer control strategies. Cdc42 is a member of the Rho GTPase family and plays an important role in cell-to-cell adhesion, formation of cytoskeletal structures, and cell cycle regulation. It thus influences cellular proliferation, transformation, and homeostasis, as well as the cellular migration and invasion processes underlying tumor formation. Cdc42 acts as a collection point for signal transduction and regulates multiple signaling pathways. Moreover, recent studies show that in most human cancers Cdc42 is abnormally expressed and promoting neoplastic growth and metastasis. Regarding possible new treatments for cancer, miRNA and small molecules targeting Cdc42 and related pathways have been recently found to be effective on cancer. In this review, we analyze the newly recognized regulation mechanisms for Cdc42 and Cdc42-related signal pathways, and particularly new treatments using small molecules and miRNAs to inhibit the abnormal overexpression of Cdc42 that may slow down the metastasis process, improve cancer therapy and lead to novel strategies for development of antineoplastic drugs.

Motivation: In recent years, vast advances in biomedical technologies and comprehensive sequencing have revealed the genomic landscape of common forms of human cancer in unprecedented detail. The broad heterogeneity of the disease calls for rapid development of personalized therapies. Translating the readily available genomic data into useful knowledge that can be applied in the clinic remains a challenge. Computational methods are needed to aid these efforts by robustly analyzing genome-scale data from distinct experimental platforms for prioritization of targets and treatments. Results: We propose a novel, biologically motivated, Bayesian multitask approach, which explicitly models gene-centric dependencies across multiple and distinct genomic platforms. We introduce a gene-wise prior and present a fully Bayesian formulation of a group factor analysis model. In supervised prediction applications, our multitask approach leverages similarities in response profiles of groups of drugs that are more likely to be related to true biological signal, which leads to more robust performance and improved generalization ability. We evaluate the performance of our method on molecularly characterized collections of cell lines profiled against two compound panels, namely the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and the Cancer Therapeutics Response Portal. We demonstrate that accounting for the gene-centric dependencies enables leveraging information from multi-omic input data and improves prediction and feature selection performance. We further demonstrate the applicability of our method in an unsupervised dimensionality reduction application by inferring genes essential to tumorigenesis in the pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and lung adenocarcinoma patient cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas.
